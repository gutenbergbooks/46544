<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The present volume was announced in the preface to
"Christianity and Greek Philosophy" as nearly ready
for publication under the title of "Christianity and Modern
Thought."</p>

<p>Several considerations have induced the author to delay
its appearance, the most influential of which has
been the desire to await the culmination among a class
of self-styled "advanced thinkers" of what they have
been pleased to call "the tendency of modern thought."
No extraordinary sagacity was needed to foresee the issue,
or to predict that it must soon be reached. The transition
has been rapid from negative criticism of the Christian
religion to direct assault upon the very foundation
of all religion&mdash;the personality and providence of God.
Distrust of a supernatural revelation, and denial of all
authority to the teaching of the sacred Scriptures, has
been succeeded by doubt of the existence of God in the
proper import of that sacred name. The Theistic postulate
is degraded to the rank of a mere hypothesis, which is
pronounced inadequate to explain the universe. A "law-governed
Cosmos, full of life and reason," eternal and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>finite,
must now take the place of a personal God, the
Creator and Ruler of the universe. This is the "New
Faith" which is to supersede the Old.</p>

<p>The question, "Are we still Christians?" has received
a final answer in the words of Strauss: "If we would
speak as honest, upright men, we must acknowledge we
are no longer Christians."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And in giving this answer he
is confident he speaks in the name of a large and rapidly
increasing number of men who once believed in the truth
of Christianity&mdash;"The We I mean no longer counts only
by thousands."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The further question, "Have we still a
Religion?" (understanding by religion "the recognition
and veneration of God, and the belief in a future life")
is also answered in the negative. Religion "is a delusion,
to abolish which ought to be the endeavor of every man
whose eyes are open to the truth."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The only question
which now remains for the speculative intellect is, "What
is our conception of the Universe?"&mdash;the conception
which henceforth must take the place of a personal God.
The answer of Strauss is explicit, and in his estimation
final: "The conception of the Cosmos, instead of that of
a personal God as the finality to which we are led by
perception and thought, or as the ultimate fact beyond
which we can not proceed, ... assumes the more definite
shape of matter infinitely agitated, which, by differentiation
and integration, develops itself to ever higher forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and functions, and describes an everlasting circle by evolution,
dissolution, and then fresh evolution."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>This may be called pantheism or atheism, materialism
or idealism, just as we please; Strauss has no solicitude
about mere names. "If this be considered pure, unmitigated
materialism, I will not dispute it. In fact, I have
always tacitly regarded the contrast so loudly proclaimed
between materialism and idealism (or by whatever term
one may designate the view opposed to the former) as a
mere quarrel about words. They have a common foe in
the dualism which pervaded the conception of the world
throughout the Christian era, dividing man into body
and soul, his existence into time and eternity, and opposing
an eternal Creator to a created and perishable
universe."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The end is reached at last&mdash;no soul, no God, no providence,
no immortality! We have waited for a culmination,
and now we are called upon to look, "not into the
golden Orient, but vaguely all around into a dim, copper
firmament pregnant with earthquake and tornado." Or,
rather, we are called to look into an abyss, and, "shouting
question after question into the Sibyl-cave of Destiny,
receive no answer" save "the Everlasting No." It only
remains for us to listen to Strauss's <i>De Profundis</i> and
retire. "The loss of the belief in providence belongs,
indeed, to the most sensible deprivations which are connected
with a renunciation of Christianity. In the enor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>mous
machine of the universe, amid the incessant whirl
and hiss of its jagged iron wheels, amid the deafening
crash of its ponderous stamps and hammers, in the midst
of this whole terrific commotion, man&mdash;a helpless and defenseless
creature&mdash;finds himself placed, not secure for a
moment that on some imprudent motion a wheel may
not seize and rend him, or a hammer crush him to powder.
This sense of abandonment is at first something awful.
But, then, what avails it to have recourse to an illusion?
Our wish is impotent to refashion the world; the
understanding clearly shows that it indeed is such a machine.
But it is not merely this. We do not only find
the revolution of pitiless wheels in our world-machine, but
also the shedding of soothing oil. Our God [the world-machine]
does not, indeed, take us into his arms from the
outside, but he unseals the well-spring of consolation within
our own bosoms.... He who can not help himself in
this matter is beyond help, is not yet ripe for our stand-point."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>There is a weighty and solemn lesson in this illustration
of the "tendency of modern thought"&mdash;a lesson which
even Strauss intended to teach the age, viz., that there is
no discernible <i>via media</i> between "the Old Faith and
the New"&mdash;between the belief in a personal God and the
impersonal All. The "New Faith" must at last be the
faith of all who reject <i>providence</i>, that providence which
is pre-eminently revealed in history, instituting a king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>dom
of God upon earth by a supernatural guidance and
grace.</p>

<p>The issue, now so sharply and clearly defined, between
<i>a God and no God</i>, has determined a change in the plan
of our work, and justifies, we trust, the attempt we have
made to restate and defend "The Theistic Conception of
the World."</p>

<p>Those who have done me the honor to read "Christianity
and Greek Philosophy" will detect in the present
volume a radical change of views concerning the concepts
Time and Space. This change of position is the result of
patient reconsideration of this branch of the discussion,
and we allude to it here simply to guard against the
charge of unconscious inconsistency. The views presented
in this volume must stand or fall on their own merits.</p>

<p>The author has to acknowledge many obligations to his
friend, Dr. Bernard Moses, for material aid rendered in
getting this work through the press.</p>

<p>"To such readers as have reflected on man's life; who understand that
for man's well-being Faith is properly the one thing needful; how with it
martyrs, otherwise weak, can cheerfully endure the shame and the cross;
and without it worldlings puke up their sick existence by suicide in the
midst of luxury: to such it will be clear that for a pure moral nature, the
loss of religious belief is the loss of every thing.</p>

<p>"All wounds, the crush of long-continued destitution, the stab of false
friendship and of false love, all wounds in thy so genial heart, would have
healed again had not its life-warmth been withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Well mayest thou exclaim,'Is there no God, then; but at best an absentee
God, sitting idle, ever since the first Sabbath, at the outside of his
universe and seeing it go?' 'Has the word Duty no meaning; is what we
call Duty no Divine messenger and guide, but a false earthly phantasm made
up of desire and fear?' 'Is the heroic inspiration we name Virtue but some
passion; some bubble of the blood, bubbling in the direction others profit
by?' I know not; only this I know, If what thou namest Happiness be our
true aim, then are we all astray. 'Behold, thou art fatherless, outcast, and
the universe is&mdash;the Devil's.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p>

THE PROBLEM STATED.</h2>


<p>As Archimedes demanded only one fixed point in order
to move the world, so Descartes desired to find one certain
and indubitable principle upon which he could plant his
feet and lift himself out of the universal doubt which environed
him. He found it in the proposition&mdash;I exist.
This for me is the most direct, immediate, and certain of
all intuitions. I can not doubt, I can not deny my own
existence. Whatever else I doubt, I can not doubt that I,
the doubter, exist. This I that thinks, that is conscious, is
the fundamental <i>reality</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>I see around me a plurality of personal existences who
are self-conscious and self-manifesting beings&mdash;beings who
think and feel, and display their activities in time and
space, as I do; and I can no more doubt their existence
than I can doubt my own. This combination of the content
of external perception with that of internal perception
gives the immediate consciousness of external <i>reality</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these personal existences analogous to my own,
there are other objects which exist in relation to my corporeal
organism&mdash;relations of position, distance, and direction,
which are purely objective. These existences offer
resistance to my muscular effort to displace them in space,
and defy all my mental effort to reduce them to the category
of subjective phenomena. These objects have specific
properties or exist in certain conditions which, in their
mutual relation with my sensitive organism, produce in
me certain vital affections, as heat, light, color, and sound.
These affections presuppose a force or energy outside of
my consciousness, and distinct from myself. Thus I am
constrained to believe that the earth on which I tread, the
heavens that shine upon me, the forms and movements
which surround me, are not vain shadows, unreal phantoms
of my own creation, but real entities. The totality of existence
called the universe is for me a <i>reality</i>.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the universe are in ceaseless flow and
change. Bodies are aggregated and dissolved. Plants
are evolved from germs, they live and grow, then decay
and perish. Animals and men are born and developed to
maturity, then they sicken and die. The earth itself is in
constant change. The storms of heaven, the erosion of
the atmosphere, the gnawing of the tidal wave, the mountain
torrent, the flowing river, the earthquake and the
volcano, are perpetually changing the aspect of the globe.
There is perpetual <i>genesis</i>, ceaseless <i>becoming</i>, incessant
<i>change</i>.</p>

<p>Beneath all these changes there is an enduring "something."
There are abiding constants as well as fleeting
changes; enduring realities as well as unstable phenomena.
The same forms and relations, the same forces and laws,
the same analogous functions, and the same archetypal
ideas, remain amid all individual changes. There is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
enduring <i>substance</i> which is the subject of all these
changes. There is a permanent force, or <i>power</i>, which is
the cause of all change. There are constant numerical
proportions, determinate geometrical forms, specific ideal
archetypes, and special ends, which give the law of all
change. The universe is not a mere aggregation of phenomena,
a mere concourse of things in time and space
with accidental resemblances: it is a <i>unity</i>, a cosmos, a
harmonious whole, both in its contemporaneous and successive
history.</p>

<p>So much is and always has been known, with more or
less clearness and distinctness by all men, and known by
a spontaneous and immediate intuition. This intuition,
like every intuition, even the commonest intuition of
sense, has had a gradual development both in the consciousness
of the individual, and in the consciousness of
the race. It has always been immanent in human thought
even when not articulately expressed in human language.
To the native common-sense of our race, the world is a
reality, not a dream; to the universal reason of mankind
the universe is a harmony, not a chaos. Men have instinctively
apprehended some ideal relations, some causal
connection, some adaptation and purpose in nature, and
they have always had some intuition, however dim and
shadowy, of an <i>all-pervading unity</i>, and an <i>ultimate
causative principle</i>.</p>

<p>But when the universe has become the object of <i>reflective</i>
thought, when man has attempted a colligation of
the individual facts, and an ideal construction and rational
interpretation of the phenomena, when he has
sought to grasp the manifoldness and diversity of nature
in a higher unity of thought, and, above all, when he has
attempted to pass beyond phenomena and their relations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and form a conception of <i>the absolute reality and ultimate
cause</i>&mdash;then it is that difficulties have arisen and
questions have presented themselves which have perplexed
the discursive reason, and taxed the genius of the
ablest thinkers of every age.</p>


<p>1. First of all, there have arisen the fundamental questions:
Has the universe always existed, or had the Cosmos,
with its changes and constants, its forces and laws,
its forms and relations, a <i>Beginning</i>? Is its present condition
but one link in an endless chain, one phasis in a
series of changes, which had no beginning and shall have
no end? Is the universe limited both in space and duration,
or is it unlimited, unbeginning, and endless?</p>


<p>2. If the universe had a beginning, what is the ἀρχῆ&mdash;the
originant, causative Principle in which or from which
it had its beginning? How are we to conceive aright that
First Principle of all existence and of all knowledge?
is it material or spiritual, intelligent or unintelligent?</p>


<p>3. What conception are we to form of the nature and
mode of that beginning? Was it a pure supernatural
Origination&mdash;an absolute creation? or was it simply a
Formation out of a first matter or first force&mdash;an artistic,
architectonic, demiurgic creation? Was that beginning
determined by necessity or by choice? Was it an unconscious
emanation from, or a necessary development of,
the First Principle; or was it a conscious forth-putting
of power for the realization of a foreseen, premeditated,
predetermined plan&mdash;a <i>mental</i> Order.</p>


<p>4. A supernatural Origination being assumed, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
from that first initial act of absolute creation, has the process
of formation been gradual, continuous, and uniform&mdash;a
progressive <i>Evolution</i> from the homogeneous to the
heterogeneous, from lower to higher forms, according to
a changeless law of uniformity and continuity? or have
there been marked, distinct, and successive stages of formation&mdash;creative
epochs which may be called "new beginnings?"
Is the historic unity of creation a unity of
Thought, an ideal consecution? or is it simply a physical
unity grounded in a material nexus&mdash;a genetic connection
resulting from the necessary action of physical causes?</p>


<p>5. What is the relation of the Creator to the existing
creation? Is the Deity, in any sense, immanent in, or
does he dwell altogether apart from, and out of all connection
with, the universe? Has any finite thing or being
an independent existence? Have the forces of nature
any reality apart from the Divine efficiency? Did the
Creator, in the beginning, give self-being to the substance
of the universe, and endow it with properties and forces,
so that it can exist and act apart from, and independently
of, the First Cause? or is God still in nature upholding all
substance, the power of all force, the life of all life, shaping
all forms, and organizing all systems? Is God not
only the Creator but the <i>Conservator</i> of all things?</p>


<p>6. Is there any Ethical meaning, any moral significance
in the universe? Is the physical order of the universe
subordinated to a moral order in which freedom exists?
Are there any indications that the existence of moral personality
is the end toward which all the successive changes
of nature have tended, and the progressive types of life
have been a preparation and a prophecy? Was the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
designed to be a theatre for the development of moral
character, the education and discipline of moral beings?
Does the course of history reveal "a power that works
for righteousness," and aims at the highest perfection of
rational and free beings? In a word, is there a <i>Providential</i>
Government of the world?</p>


<p>7. Does man stand in a more immediate relation to
God than the things of nature? Is each individual the
charge of a providence, the subject of a moral government,
and the heir to a future retribution? Has man a
spiritual and immortal nature? Has he the power so to
determine his own action and character that he can justly
be held accountable, and treated as the proper subject of
reward and punishment? In the final issue of things, will
every human being meet his righteous deserts, and be rewarded
or punished according to his works? In short, is
man under <i>Moral Government</i>?</p>


<p>These are the great, the vital questions of to-day. In
one form or another they have engaged the attention and
stimulated the earnest thought of the ablest and best of
minds in past ages; and, whether from the inherent demand
of reason, or the promptings of instinctive curiosity,
they have a deeper hold on the mind of this, than of any
preceding age.</p>


<p>We approach the discussion of these questions with a
profound conviction of their magnitude and difficulty,
and an oppressive foreboding that our essay will be pronounced
ambitious and vain. Their vastness seems to
defy our admeasurement, and their complexity and difficulty
may defeat our feeble efforts at solution. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
mer-de-glace of the Infinite is covered with myriads of
philosophic insects which have been carried up there and
lost." May we hope for any better fate? Do the problems
permit any solution at all?</p>

<p>Of one thing, at any rate, we are sure: these questions
are native to the human mind. They arise spontaneously
in presence of the facts of the universe. However much
of human effort to solve these problems has ended in failure
and defeat, the human mind has never lost confidence
in the possibility of their ultimate solution, and humanity
has never abandoned them in despair.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> A few impatient
souls have plunged into Pyrrhonism and taken refuge in
universal skepticism; while others have sought to organize
nescience into a science. But patient, earnest souls
have never cast away their faith in the integrity of universal
reason, and have never ceased to believe that its
ideas and laws are, in truth, the ideas and laws of the universe.
These problems are the great problems of all
philosophy, and all religion; and unless philosophy be a
dream, and religion an illusion, they are capable of such
a solution as shall satisfy the reason of man.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>viction,
which is common to the mass of thoughtful men,
will justify every attempt of philosophy to attain to an
ultimate unity of thought. The ultimate harmony of
physical, philosophical, and religious truth is the faith of
all noble minds.</p>

<p>The signs of the times are propitious. To-day the conflict
between reason and faith, science and religion, presents
many hopeful indications of an approaching conciliation.
Candid men in both fields are earnestly working,
and patiently watching, and hourly catching clearer
glimpses of the everlasting harmony which pervades the
universe of being and of thought. Every, even the smallest,
contribution made with an honest purpose to give confidence
and collimation to this movement, will be welcome
to all earnest minds. This may be our apology for attempting
a task that belongs to stronger intellects than
ours.</p>

<p>It is obvious, at first thought, that the questions before
us admit of no loose and desultory treatment. Abysses
are not to be concealed by laurel screens, or chasms bridged
by flowers of rhetoric. If we are to reach any satisfactory
conclusions, our procedure must be rigidly systematic and
logically exact. We must have a fixed point of departure,
and, if possible, a faultless method of advance. The fundamental
question must be determined. The central problem
must be ascertained, and we must deal with all correlative
questions in their logical connection with the one
fundamental inquiry.</p>

<p>First of all, then, can we place that central problem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
clearly before our mental vision? Amid the diverse questions
which spontaneously arise in presence of the diversified
phenomena of nature, and the wonderful evolutions
of humanity, can we fix upon the <i>one</i> question in which
all others are involved&mdash;the grand underlying problem
which comprehends them all?</p>

<p>A little reflection will make it apparent that the problem
of all problems is this&mdash;</p>

<p><i>How shall we conceive aright the</i> <span class="smcap">FIRST PRINCIPLE</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">ORIGIN</span> <i>of all things, itself unoriginated and unbeginning,
the source of all beginnings? Or again, what is that</i>
<span class="smcap">FIRST PRINCIPLE</span> <i>which, being assumed, shall be found a
sufficient explanation of the motion and change, the order
and adaptation, the life and feeling, the consciousness
and reason, we call, collectively, the universe</i>?</p>

<p>This is clearly the fundamental question on which all
the others are grounded, and in the solution of which they
have their solution.</p>

<p>The universe presents itself to sense and sense-perception
as a perpetual genesis, "a vast aggregation and history of
phenomena conditioned in time and space which, by its
diversity and mutability, is disqualified from being regarded
as independent and self-existent." To our experiential
knowledge, to our physical science in its highest
generalizations, the universe is a product, an <i>effect</i>. And
it is an effect for which the reason demands an explanation
and a cause. It is a manifoldness and diversity which
the logical understanding is ceaselessly endeavoring to reduce
to a unity. Indeed, every movement of thought, from
the first rude attempt at classification on the simple basis
of resemblance, upward to the recognition of more profound
ideal relations and uniform laws, until its culmination
in the highest integration of reason, is but the effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of the mind to grasp the individual facts of nature in a
unity of thought, and interpret the universe according to
principles and ideas which the reason supplies.</p>

<p>The moment reflective thought is directed to the phenomenal
world, the questions spontaneously arise&mdash;Out of what
does the phenomenal come? By what agency or efficiency
does it arise? Why does it present itself in this order
rather than another? Or, more specifically&mdash;What is the
abiding <i>reality</i> which sustains the array of phenomena?
What is the invisible <i>power</i> which effects all the changes
we see around us? What is that unseen <i>presence</i> which
determines the forms, relations, and adaptations which
every where present themselves to the reason of man? In
a word, <i>What is that ultimate principle&mdash;the last or remotest
in the order of analytic thought, the first in the
order of being and of reason&mdash;which sustains and moves
and organizes and governs all</i>&mdash;that fundamental, abiding
<span class="smcap">primus</span> which is everlastingly present behind the scenery
and changes of the world&mdash;<i>that which always was,
and now is, and ever shall be</i> <span class="smcap">FIRST</span>? Or if we permit
ourselves to regard the present order of things as a necessary
out-birth from the past, still we are compelled by a
laborious effort of regressive thought to climb upward
through a series of changes to an absolutely <span class="smcap">FIRST</span> of the
series conditioning all the other members, but itself unconditioned.
Few will now claim that this is the natural
and adequate cosmical conception; but, even under this
mode of conception, we can not but feel that a development
without a beginning of the process, a series without
a first term, is impossible. "The absolute infinity of a series
is a contradiction <i>in adjecto</i>. As every number, although
immeasurably and inconceivably great, is impossible
unless unity is given as its basis, so every series, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
itself a number, is impossible unless a first term is given
as its commencement." Therefore the question still returns&mdash;What
is that First Principle of all things?</p>

<p>In obedience to this demand of reason, or impelled by
an innate "wonder"&mdash;"the feeling of the philosopher"&mdash;men
have in all ages attempted an ideal construction and
rational interpretation of the universe.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Mythologies,
Cosmogonies, Philosophies, Religions of the ancient world
were the simple products of this innate tendency. Beyond
the circle of thought illuminated by Divine revelation, the
first movement of reflection was unmethodical and incomplete.
Pursuing the inquiries objectively, that is, in the
realm of outward nature, and not subjectively in the realm
of reason, the human mind was perpetually entangled with
dualistic conceptions. There were contrarieties, polarities,
antagonisms, which the logical understanding could not
cancel. Hence we have, as an early, perhaps the earliest,
form of construction, an Oriental Dualism&mdash;as in the
Adonis and Moloch of the Phoenicians, the Isis and Osiris
of the Egyptians, the Ormuzd and Ahriman of the Persians,
the Chaos and Love of Orpheus, the Plenum and Vacuum
(Matter and Space) of Democritus, and even some lingering
taint in the God and Necessity of Plato's "Timæus."</p>

<p>But all this was unsatisfactory to human reason, which
is a <i>unity</i>, and which makes its imperious demand that
<i>absolute unity</i> shall stand at the fountain-head of being.
It has never been able to rest in an Ultimate which was
not an Absolute&mdash;that is, a <i>unity</i> which by its very idea
and conception is the negation of all plurality and mutability;
a <i>unity</i> which is unconditioned, and yet which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
conditions all; an "eternal constancy," the voluntary cause
of all genesis and all change.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is a law of reason, under
which alone it can maintain its integrity, that the <i>First
Cause must be</i> <span class="smcap">ONE</span>, <i>and not many</i>. An absolute cause
must be one in order to be absolute; two absolutes is a
contradiction. With more or less clearness, men in all
ages have apprehended that "the <i>First Principle must
be one or nothing</i>."</p>

<p>This is tacitly conceded in all modern systems of
thought. Büchner, the materialist; Spencer, the dynamist;
Hegel, the idealist; Cousin and Coleridge, the spiritualists,
know no divergence here. Atheism, Pantheism,
and Theism alike commence with unity at the fountain-head
of being&mdash;a unity which is incomposite, absolutely
continuous, every where present and eternal. Every system
of philosophy is essentially an effort to show how
the universe that now is has been originated by, or
evolved out of, or has emanated from, a First Principle,
an absolute Unity. To determine whether this absolute
First Principle can be known, and, if known, how conceived
and expressed aright, is the ultimate problem of
all philosophy and all religion.</p>

<p>All the answers which have been given, and, indeed,
all which can be conceived, are contained in the following
four propositions:</p>

<p>1. <i>In the beginning was</i> <span class="smcap">MATTER</span>&mdash;matter as the original
substance or substratum, with its inherent, essential,
and necessary attribute of force; this alone is eternal and
infinite. "No force without matter&mdash;no matter without
force." "Matter and its immanent force is immortal
and indestructible." "The world is unlimited and infinite."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Matter, with its primary forces of attraction and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
repulsion, cohesion and affinity, is fully adequate to the
explanation of all the phenomena of the universe, physical,
vital, and mental.</p>

<p>2. <i>In the beginning was</i> <span class="smcap">FORCE</span>&mdash;force homogeneous but
unstable, and necessarily tending to differentiation and
heterogeneity; splitting into opposites, standing off into
polarities, ramifying into attractions and repulsions, light,
heat, magnetism, and electricity; and mounting up through
the stages of physical, vital, and neural to the mental life
itself, with all its varied and endless phenomena, as revealed
in the languages, laws, institutions, arts, sciences,
and religions of the world. Force is "the ultimate of all
ultimates," the "Absolute Reality," the "Unconditioned
Cause."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>In the beginning was</i> <span class="smcap">THOUGHT</span>&mdash;thought as an eternal
process of self-manifestation and self-actualization,
which in its necessary evolution reveals itself as force,
and expresses itself in the varied types of existence and
laws of phenomena, natural and spiritual. "<i>The Absolute
Idea</i>," as a perpetual process, an eternal thinking, is
the supreme principle of all reality. "The idea of the
Absolute Spirit comprehends the entire wealth of the
natural and the spiritual world; it is the only substance
and truth of this wealth, and nothing is true and real except
so far as it forms an element of its being."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>4. <i>In the beginning was</i> <span class="smcap">WILL</span>&mdash;an unconditioned Will
as the indivisible unity and perpetual differentiation of
<i>Reason</i> and <i>Power</i> and <i>Love</i>. This Unconditioned Will
is the causative principle of all Reality, all Efficiency, and
all Perfection&mdash;a causative principle containing, predetermining,
and producing all the manifold forms and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>lations,
forces and laws of the universe in reference to a
final purpose. This <i>Absolute First Cause</i> is a living personal
Being, "from whom, in whom, and to whom are all
things."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The first and second of these propositions coalesce with
the creed of <i>Atheism</i>, the third with the creed of <i>Pantheism</i>,
the fourth is the creed of <i>Theism</i>, and, as we hope
to prove in subsequent chapters, the only rational and adequate
explanation of the facts of the universe.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br/>
GOD THE CREATOR.</h2>

<p>"In the beginning <span class="smcap">God</span> created the heaven and the earth."&mdash;Gen. i. 1.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">God</span> that made the world and all things therein.... He is Lord of
heaven and earth."&mdash;Acts xvii. 24.</p>

<p>"The Eternal Will is the creator of the world as He is the creator of the
finite person."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fichte</span>.</p>


<p><i>God is the first principle, the unconditioned cause of
all existence.</i> This is the answer of Christian doctrine to
the great problem presented for solution in the preceding
chapter. Whether this fundamental presupposition
shall be finally accepted as the only adequate solution of
the problem of existence will depend in a large degree
upon our apprehension of the Christian idea of God. We
shall, therefore, open the discussion by asking the question&mdash;What
is the content of our conception of God?</p>

<p>Dogmatic theology might rest satisfied with the simple
affirmation,"<i>God is</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as against all the captious demands
of science, were it not necessary to render an account
to itself of what, at first sight, might be pronounced
a "sublime tautology." For, while it is hereby confessed
that God in his essential being is incomprehensible and
ineffable, so that to the Christian as well as to the philosopher
he is "the great Unknown," still it is not hereby
admitted that it is absolutely impossible to know God.
To affirm that God is absolutely "the Unknowable" is
simply to assert his unreality. Mr. Martineau has finely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
observed that this term is self-contradictory; for we affirm
by the use of it that we know so much that He can
not be known. Nay, it assumes the existence of God, and
in the same breath separates us from Him forever. But
if it be admitted that God <i>is</i>, it can not be absolutely impossible
to know <i>what</i> He is. The knowledge of existence
and the form of existence mutually condition each
other. There must be something in the understanding
answering to the term in the language of mankind, and
there must be something in the realm of being which is
the ground of the idea in the reason of Man. The heathen
have a presentiment, a dim intuition of the "unknown
God," and the inspired teacher may so "declare
Him" in human language that his hearers may receive
a definite notion, and attain to a practical knowledge of
God.</p>

<p>The <i>idea</i> of God is a common phenomenon of the universal
intelligence of our race, and must have been present
to the thought of man even before he uttered the
<i>name</i> of God.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The moment man becomes conscious of
himself, and knows himself as distinct from the world,
that same moment he becomes conscious of a <i>Higher
Self</i>&mdash;a living Power upon which both himself and the
world depend. For this Higher Self all nations have
found a name. All languages have a term cognate with
the Saxon "God," which expresses that spontaneous consciousness
of a supernatural power which is common to
all minds&mdash;that intuition of a supramundane existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
which is the ground and reason of all other existence.
Even Polytheism has a name for the abstract of all the
gods, which sets forth the ideas of being, power, causality,
and personality. And in Christian lands the term God,
without any periphrasis, at once represents the idea of a
Being distinct from self and the world, who is the Maker
of the world and the Father of humanity. For all practical
ends it is enough to say God is <i>God</i>. It is only
when reflective thought seeks to express some more specific
and determinate conception of the Supreme Being
that we find ourselves under the necessity of adding other
expletives to this term God.</p>

<p>It is therefore desirable that we should set down, in a
provisional form, the general conception of God as it exists
in the mind of the Theist and the Christian. I can
not do this better than by selecting from the writings of
three men of diverse schools of thought&mdash;one a Physicist,
another a Metaphysician, the third a Theologian; and all
in a greater or less degree influenced by the teaching of
the Christian Scriptures.</p>

<p>My first selection will be from the "Meditations" of
Descartes, who is regarded as "the father of modern philosophy."
"By the name of God," says he, "I mean an
infinite, eternal, immutable, independent, omniscient, omnipresent
substance, by which I and all other things which
are have been created and produced."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>My second selection is from the "Principia" of Sir Isaac
Newton, a work which, by the general consent of the scientific
world, is the greatest contribution ever made to
science. Sir Isaac Newton was a Physicist rather than a
Metaphysician; he will therefore represent to us the conception
of God entertained by the scientific Theist. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the close of this his great work he writes: "The true God
is a living, intelligent, powerful Being, and, from His other
perfections, it follows that He is Supreme, or most perfect.
He is eternal and infinite, omnipotent and omniscient;
that is, His duration reaches from eternity to eternity,
His presence from infinity to infinity. He governs
all things, and knows all things that are or can be done.
He is not eternity and infinity, but eternal and infinite.
He is not duration or space, but He endures and is present.
He endures forever, and He is every where present;
and by existing always and every where, He constitutes [or
causes] duration and space. Since every particle of space
is <i>always</i>, and every indivisible moment of duration is <i>every
where</i>, certainly the Maker and Lord of all things can
not be <i>never</i> and <i>nowhere</i>.... God is the same God, always
and every where. He is omnipresent, not <i>virtually</i>
[potentially] only, but also substantially; for virtue can
not subsist without substance. In Him all things are contained
and moved, yet neither affects the other. God
suffers nothing from the motion of bodies; bodies find no
resistance from the omnipresence of God. It is allowed
by all that the Supreme God exists necessarily; and by
the same necessity exists <i>always</i> and <i>every where</i>.... We
know Him only by His most wise and excellent contrivances
of things and final causes; we admire Him for His
perfections; but we reverence and adore Him on account
of His dominion. A God without dominion, providence,
and final causes is nothing else but Fate and Nature.
Blind mechanical necessity, which is certainly the same
always and every where, could produce no variety of things.
All that diversity of natural things which we find suited
to different times and places could arise from nothing but
the <i>ideas</i> and <i>will</i> of a Being necessarily existing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>My last selection is from the "Grammar of Assent," by
John Henry Newman, formerly a Protestant, now a Catholic
divine. Prior to his change of theological position
he published a remarkable work "On the Development of
Christian Doctrine in Aid of a Grammar of Assent,"
the design of which is to exhibit the influence of philosophic
thought upon the evolution of Christian doctrine,
and to bring it into harmony with the theories of Cosmical,
Physiological, and Historical development, which
seem for the present to be in the ascendant. For this
reason I choose to employ his words, as setting forth the
conception of God which is generally entertained by
thoughtful men. At page ninety-seven of his last work,
"The Grammar of Assent," I read:</p>

<p>"There is one God, such and such in Nature and Attributes.
I say 'such and such,' for, unless I explain
what I mean by <i>one God</i>, I use words which may mean
any thing or nothing. I may mean a mere <i>anima
mundi</i>; or an initial principle which once was in action
and now is not; or collective humanity. I speak then of
the one God of the Theist and of the Christian: a God
who is numerically One, who is Personal; the Author,
Sustainer, and Finisher of all things, the Life of Law and
Order, the moral Governor. One who is Supreme and
Sole; like Himself, unlike all things besides Himself,
which all are but his creatures; distinct from, independent
of, them all. One who is self-existing, absolutely infinite,
who has ever been and ever will be, to whom nothing
is past or future; who is all perfection, and the fullness
and archetype of every possible excellence, the Truth
itself, Wisdom, Love, Justice, Holiness; One who is All-powerful,
All-knowing, Omnipresent, Incomprehensible.
These are some of the distinctive prerogatives which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
ascribe unconditionally and unreservedly to the great
Being whom I call God."</p>

<p>These statements of the Theistic conception will be regarded
by most men as adequate and satisfactory. They
will be accepted by the scientific Theist and approved by
the dogmatic Theologian. They present the idea of God
within the sphere of Christian thought; that is, reflective
thought informed and illuminated by the revelations of
God which are given in the Christian Scriptures. At the
same time it must be confessed that they are defective
in scientific form, philosophical development, and logical
articulation. They do not present the conception of God
in harmony with any <i>principles of Rational Integration</i>.
They show no attempt to combine the various elements
of this conception in the unity of an <i>Absolute Principle</i>,
an <i>Ultimate and Fundamental Idea</i>.</p>

<p>The aim of all true philosophy is to attain to the insight
of First Principles, yea, to the insight of the Absolute
First Principle from which whatever now <i>is</i> must be
derived, and in which whatever <i>is</i> must have its intelligible
ground and sufficient reason. There exists in man,
as the essential characteristic of his humanity, a power
or faculty of intelligence, best named the <i>Reason</i>, which
awakens in him the desire and furnishes to him the law
that enables him to fulfill the inherent desire of combining
all his manifold knowledges in the unity of such
<i>Absolute First Principle</i>; and the one fundamental law
of this faculty is the <i>Law of Sufficient Reason</i>, which
has been thus enounced by Leibnitz: "Whatever exists, or
begins to be, must have a sufficient reason for its existence,
and why it is as it is, and not otherwise;" or, to give
the principle a fuller, and at the same time a legitimate
expansion&mdash;For all genesis, or beginning, there must be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
adequate <i>Cause</i>; beneath all appearance, all changeful and
fleeting phenomena, there must be a permanent <i>Being</i> or
<i>Reality</i>; beyond all the diverse and manifold, there must
be an ultimate <i>Identity</i>, an incomposite indivisible <i>Unity</i>;
and in all order and special adaptation, there must be a
unifying <i>Thought</i>, a definite <i>Purpose</i> and <i>End</i>.</p>

<p>The Reason of man can find satisfaction and harmony
only in the recognition of an Absolute First Principle
which shall comprehend and unite all these universal and
necessary ideas which are the correlates of the facts of experience;
that is, an Absolute First Principle which shall
be the Ultimate Reality, the Ultimate Cause, the Ultimate
Unity, and the Ultimate Reason of all existence. In other
words, the Reason is not and can not be satisfied without
"the clear insight of a <i>Causative Principle</i> containing,
predetermining, and producing all the actual results we
see around us, with their orderly relations in reference to
a final purpose, reason, or end; and which causative principle
exists not only as the originative and constructive,
but also as the conservative energy of all things;" a Being
who "is before all things, and by whom all things consist,"
"from whom, in whom, and to whom are all things."</p>

<p>And now what is this Absolute First Principle, causative
of all existence, which the spontaneous reason has
always intuitively apprehended, and which the reflective
reason has always found to be the adequate, and only
adequate explanation of the universe? I answer in a
word, it is <span class="smcap">AN UNCONDITIONED WILL OR SELF-DIRECTIVE
POWER, SEEING ITS OWN WAY, AND HAVING THE REASON AND
LAW OF ITS ACTION IN ITSELF ALONE</span>. This always and every
where has been intuitively apprehended, with more or
less clearness, as standing at the fountain-head of all existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, we shall postulate as the fundamental axiom
of all rational integration, viz., <span class="smcap">AN UNCONDITIONED WILL</span>,
<i>the principle of all Reality, all Efficiency, and all Perfection</i>.</p>

<p>1. An unconditioned Will which realizes itself in <span class="smcap">IPSËITY</span>&mdash;self-potency
and self-affirmation; expresses itself in that
august name of God "<span class="smcap">I AM</span>;" and constitutes <span class="smcap">ABSOLUTE
REALITY</span>.</p>

<p>2. An unconditioned Will which manifests itself in <span class="smcap">ALTERITY</span>&mdash;pluri-efficiency;
utters itself in the "<span class="smcap">I WILL</span>" of
the creative fiat; and constitutes <span class="smcap">INFINITE EFFICIENCY</span>.</p>

<p>3. An unconditioned Will which returns to itself in <span class="smcap">TOTALITY</span>&mdash;a
complete Ideal to be realized in Creation; which
expresses its satisfaction in pronouncing all things "very
good," and constitutes <span class="smcap">PERFECT PERSONALITY</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prothesis</span> expresses the absolute identity or eternal
co-inherence of Reason, Love, and Power (the Divine Es<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>sence).
<span class="smcap">Thesis</span> expresses Power in the form of Love (the
Divine Self-sufficiency and Self-potency). <span class="smcap">Antithesis</span> expresses
Reason in the form of Power (the Divine Efficiency).
<span class="smcap">Synthesis</span> expresses the diversity in unity of
Reason, Love, and Power (the Divine Perfection). And
<span class="smcap">Mesothesis</span> expresses the essential correlations which integrate
the whole (the Triunity of the manifested God).
Thus Absolute Reality, Infinite Efficiency, and Perfect
Personality are all, as a triplicity, contained in the fundamental
unity of an unconditioned Will, which has Love
as its motive, Power as its agent, and Reason as its light
and law.</p>

<p>And now let us retire within our own consciousness, and
see if this fundamental axiom of rational integration&mdash;Will
as the principle of all Reality, Efficiency, and Perfection&mdash;is
not reflected in our reason, and evolved in our
inner experience. Do we not find that the central point
of our consciousness&mdash;that which makes each man what
he is in contradistinction from every other man&mdash;that
which expresses the <i>real essence of the soul</i> apart from
its formal processes and regulative laws&mdash;is the <span class="smcap">WILL</span>?
Without Will man would fall back from the elevation
which he now assumes to the level of impersonal nature:
in a word, he would be a <i>thing</i>, and not a <i>power</i>. Power,
spontaneity, causality, will&mdash;these, or similar forms, express,
as nearly as can be, the essential nature or principle
of the human soul.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Furthermore, it is obvious that mere
Power or Energy does not suffice for the notion of Will&mdash;there
must also be Reason and Affection.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Indeed, "Will
is contemplated universally as the inseparable union and
perpetual differentiation of Intelligence and originative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Power, and as such the sole ground of the intelligibility
of all causation."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>A volitional act, a moral and responsible act, must be
one which is performed under the influence of motives,
and for which, when called to account, we can assign
valid reasons. All true volition supposes a purpose or
end to be realized, an inward appetency or motive which
makes the end desirable, and the selection and adaptation
of means to accomplish that end. Power divorced from
reason is simply <i>blind force</i>, and can not be dignified with
the name of Will. The mind of man is sometimes in a
predominant state of <i>knowing</i>, sometimes in a predominant
state of <i>feeling</i>, and sometimes in a predominant state of
<i>determination</i>. To call these separate faculties, however,
is altogether beside the mark. No act of intelligence can
be performed without some determination of the Ego, no
act of determination without some cognition, and no act
of the one or the other without some amount of feeling
being mingled in the process. Thus, while each mental
state may have its distinctive characteristics, there is unity
at the root&mdash;<i>the identical Ego, spirit</i>, <span class="smcap">WILL</span>.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Sensibility is the condition, Reason is the light, Will is
the centre of human consciousness. Consciousness is a
threefold phenomenon in which feeling, knowing, and
self-determination are reciprocal elements, and in their
connection and simultaneousness, and at the same time
their differentiation, they compose the entire intellectual
life.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The finite spirit or will unfolds itself, first, subjectively,
in the spontaneous affirmation of self-being or
self-potency (<span class="smcap">IPSËITY</span>); secondly, objectively, in the exer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>tion
of power to produce motion, change, phenomena (<span class="smcap">EFFICIENCY</span>);
thirdly, synthetically, in the unity of motive
and intention, purpose and act, means and end (<span class="smcap">PERSONALITY</span>).</p>

<p>Thus does "Will present the middle point, which embraces
<i>thought</i> on the one hand and <i>force</i> on the other;
and which yet, so far from appearing to us to be a <i>compound</i>
arising out of them as an effect, is more easily conceived
as the originative prefix (prothesis) of all mental
phenomena.... It carries with it, in its very idea, the
co-presence of thought as the necessary element within
whose sphere it has to manifest itself; its phenomena can
not exist alone; it acts on preconceptions, which stand related
to it, not however as its source, but as its conditions,
and are its co-ordinates in the effect, rather than its generating
antecedents."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Psychological analysis leads us inevitably to this conclusion,
that all things are issued by Will, whether in the
sphere of the finite or the infinite, and therefore we postulate
an <span class="smcap">UNCONDITIONED WILL, A PERFECT MIND</span>, at the source
of all becoming. Thus, as Martineau truly remarks, <i>between
the</i> <span class="smcap">FORCE</span> <i>of the physical atheist and the</i> <span class="smcap">THOUGHT</span>
<i>of the metaphysical pantheist</i>, <i>we fix upon</i> <span class="smcap">WILL</span> <i>as the
true balancing-point of a moral theism</i>.</p>

<p>The intelligent reader scarce needs to be reminded
that this is the conclusion reached by reflective thought
in that best and fullest exhibition of it which is found in
Greek philosophy. The great problem of Greek philosophy,
as of all philosophy, was, "What is the ἀρχῆ, the
First Principle&mdash;the ground and cause and reason of all
existence?" The final answer of that age is found in
Plato, for Platonism was the culmination, the ripened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
fruit of the ages of earnest thought which preceded Plato.
He gathered up, co-ordinated, and grasped into unity the
results bequeathed by the mental efforts of his predecessors.
The Platonic answer to this great question of philosophy
is clear and unequivocal. A perfect <span class="smcap">MIND</span> is the
primal source of all being&mdash;a Mind in which Intellect,
Efficiency, and Goodness are one and identical. "Mind
is the most worthy ἀρχῆ." "God is the most excellent of
causes."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "Mind is king of heaven and earth."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> "Motion
and life and soul and mind are present with absolute
being. We can not imagine being to be devoid of life
and mind, remaining in awful unmeaningness and everlasting
fixture."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>"Whatever begins to be, must necessarily be produced
by some cause; for nothing can have its generation without
a cause." "The Maker and Father of the universe ...
had no beginning of his being." He formed the
universe according to the eternal model or archetype
which his own reason supplied, and for motives which his
own essential goodness proposed. "Let us now tell for
what cause the Maker of this creation and this universe
made it as it is. He was <i>good</i>; and he who is good
grudges no advantage to any creature. Being thus free
from envy, He willed that the universe should be good
like Himself; and this, the special ground of the creation
and the world, which we receive from the wisest philosophers,
we must accept."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It would be easy to show that the recognition of intelligent
Will, as standing at the fountain-head of all the
force which is manifested in the universe, is common to
the first Physicists of this age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Grove concludes his admirable essay on "The Correlation
of the Physical Forces" with these words: "In all
phenomena the more closely they are investigated the
more are we convinced that, humanly speaking, neither
matter nor force can be created or annihilated, and that
an essential cause is unattainable [by science]&mdash;<i>Causation
is the</i> <span class="smcap">WILL</span>, <i>Creation is the act</i>, <i>of God</i>."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Sir John
Herschel has not hesitated to express his conviction that
"it is but reasonable to regard the Force of Gravitation
as the direct or indirect result of a consciousness or a
<span class="smcap">WILL</span> existing somewhere."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Dr. Carpenter, with his usual
sagacity in penetrating to the essential point, remarks that
the <span class="smcap">WILL</span> "is that form of Force which must be taken
as the type of all the rest;" "Force must be regarded as
the direct expression of <span class="smcap">WILL</span>."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "If," says Wallace, "we
have traced one force, however minute, to an origin in
our own <span class="smcap">WILL</span>, while we have no knowledge of any other
primary cause of force, it does not seem an improbable
conclusion that <i>all force may be</i> <span class="smcap">WILL-FORCE</span>, and thus the
whole universe is not only dependent on, but actually is
the will of higher intelligences or of one Supreme Intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
In short, the present attitude of science in relation
to this great problem is, I think, fairly represented
by the Duke of Argyll: "Science, in the modern doctrine
of the Conservation of Energy and the Convertibility
of Forces, is already getting hold of the idea that all
kinds of Force are but forms and manifestations of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
one Central Force issuing from some one Fountain-head
of Power." "This one Force, into which all others return
again, is itself but a mode of action of the Divine <span class="smcap">Will</span>."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Even Spencer concedes that "the Force by which we ourselves
produce changes, and which serves to symbolize the
cause of changes in general, is the final disclosure of all
analysis ... all other modes of consciousness are derived
from our consciousness of exerting Force."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> "The
order of nature is doubtless very imperfect, but its production
is far more compatible with the hypothesis of an
intelligent will than with that of blind mechanism."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Physical science is surely coming into harmony with metaphysical
thought. It looks upon nature with the eye of
reason as well as the eye of sense. And it reduces the
phenomena to unity, not simply by comparative abstraction,
which classifies under resemblance, co-existence, and
succession, but by that rational integration which operates
under the necessary laws of substance, causality, intentionality,
and absolute unity. It regards the forces of nature
as the product or manifestation of a higher force&mdash;a force
which is not merely dynamical in its nature&mdash;a force
which can compass not merely concurrent and antagonistic
motions in space, but which is able so to adjust these
concurrences and antagonisms as to construct agencies
which shall realize designs&mdash;a force, therefore, which is
thoughtful and percipient: in one word, intelligent&mdash;a
force, in fine, which is not a mere mechanical dynamism
in space and time, but a true Power existing in its type
and fullness: in one word&mdash;God.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus does all reflective thought, whether directed to
the phenomena of the human mind or the phenomena of
nature, confirm the <i>à priori</i> intuition of an unconditioned
Will unfolding itself in Thought and Power, and completing
itself in a harmonious Totality, as the First Principle
and Originative Cause of all existences and of all
relations, of all individual beings, and of that harmonious
whole men call the Cosmos.</p>

<p>And now we pass to the important question&mdash;How are
we to bring all our acquired conceptions of God into harmony
with this fundamental idea? Assuming that we
have certain conceptions of God which are derived from
verbal instruction, and ultimately from Divine revelation,
can we bring these into unity under this First Principle?
Or, in other words, can we logically evolve the attributes
and perfections of God out of this fundamental Idea,
and find the result in harmony with the Christian doctrine?</p>

<p>As the object of thought, even of Christian thought,
God must necessarily be conceived by us under the fundamental
categories of <i>Being</i>, <i>Attribute</i>, and <i>Relation</i>.
All objects of thought must come under these categories,
and out of or beyond these categories we can not think at
all. Furthermore, we can not think of God as the unconditioned
Being conditioning Himself, without conceiving
Him as <i>Reality</i>, <i>Efficiency</i>, and <i>Personality</i>. These constitute
the conception of the Divine essence whereby it is
what it is. When we think of the Attributes of such a
Being, we must necessarily conceive them as <i>Absolute</i>,
<i>Infinite</i>, and <i>Perfect</i>.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And when we think of the Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>lations
of God to finite existences and finite consciousness,
we are constrained to regard Him as the <i>Ground</i> and
<i>Cause</i> and <i>Reason</i> of all dependent being.</p>

<p>In the unity and completeness of this categorical scheme
of thought, we can not fail to recognize the following logical
order:</p>

<pre>
 BEING (Essentia)               REALITY  }  EFFICIENCY }  PERSONALITY }
 ATTRIBUTE (Related Essence)    ABSOLUTE }  INFINITE   }  PERFECT     }
 RELATION (Free Determination)  GROUND      CAUSE         REASON OR END
</pre>

<p>In the Absolute Reality we have the ultimate ground; in
the Infinite Efficiency we have the adequate cause; and
in the Perfect Personality we have the sufficient reason
or final cause of all existence.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Being</span> or <span class="smcap">Essence</span>, as <i>Reality</i>, <i>Efficiency</i>, and <i>Personality</i>.
The intuition of Being is the most fundamental
and the most abstract of all ideas. After every property
and relation has been eliminated, there still remains
the affirmation that something <i>is</i>. Non-existence, except
as the negation of being, is inconceivable. But, at the
same time, pure being is the most indeterminate of all
ideas. Simple being, without attributes, and out of all relation
to other ideas, is a notion without contents, and consequently
indescribable and unknowable. For us, therefore,
pure abstract being is equal to non-being, and the
paradox of Hegel has some truth: Pure Being = Nothing.
Distinction&mdash;differentiation, determination&mdash;is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
condition of all reality. Real being must be determined,
only pure nothing can be undetermined. The least determined
being is the least real; the most determined is
the most real, the most perfect being. Exactly in proportion
as the nature of beings is differentiated and complicated
do they rise in the scale of being. The vegetable
has more determinations than inanimate matter; the percipient
animal has more determinations than the vital
plant; rational man has more determinations than the
percipient animal, he is the most complicated, the most
determined, and therefore the most perfect being in creation.
An absolutely perfect being must be the most determined
of all beings; he must contain within himself
a fullness of determinations.</p>

<p>The pantheist Spinoza tells us that determination is negation&mdash;that
is, limitation. "<i>Omnis determinatio negatio
est.</i>" Nothing can be falser or more arbitrary than this
principle. Its fallacy consists in the confusion of two
things essentially different, namely, the <i>limits of a being</i>,
and <i>its determinate characteristics</i>. A pure Ego, by determining
itself to thought, affection, or action, is not thereby
limited. The limitation or the illimitation depends
simply upon the character of the thought, affection, or act
as perfect or imperfect. "I am an intelligent being, and
my intelligence is limited; these are two facts equally
certain. The possession of intelligence is the constitutive
characteristic of my being which distinguishes me from
the brute. The limitation imposed upon my intellect,
which can only see a small number of truths at a time, is
my limit, and this is what distinguishes me from the Absolute
Being, from Perfect Intelligence which sees all
truths at a glance. That which constitutes my imperfection
is not certainly my being intelligent; therein, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
contrary, lies the strength, the richness, and the dignity of
my being. What constitutes my weakness and my nothingness
is that this intelligence is inclosed in a narrow
circle. Thus, inasmuch as I am intelligent, I participate
in being and perfection; inasmuch as I am only intelligent
within certain limits, I am imperfect."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Determination
differs from limitation as much as being differs from
nothing.</p>

<p>The Causative Principle of all reality must itself be
<i>real</i>, that is, it must be a self-manifesting and self-conscious
power, for there can be no reality without consciousness.
Being which is not known to itself, and can not
manifest itself, is as though it were not. Intuition, <i>sui
conscia</i>, is the essence of reality. Here being and knowing
are identical. It must also contain within itself a
fullness of determinations, must be rich in ideas, must be
the archetype of all possible existences. All forms and
relations, all ideas and laws, all individual and special
adaptations, all harmonious systems, must be present to
the Absolute Reality. "Uncreated must be Mental Being.
This seems an invincible necessity of all thought.
Whatever else, or whatever more it is, it must be Mental
Being" = <span class="smcap">REASON</span>.</p>

<p>The Causative Principle of all efficiency must itself be
<i>power</i>, pluri-efficiency, it must be self-determined and
self-moved, and perfectly adequate to the production of
being, motion, change, life, and intelligence objective to
itself; in a word, it must be adequate to the realization
of all the ideals which reason supplies; it must be unlimited
Infinite Efficiency = <span class="smcap">SPIRIT</span>.</p>

<p>The Causative Principle of all personality must itself
be <i>personal</i>&mdash;that is, it must have a self-conceived, self-de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>termined
purpose; must freely choose and wisely adapt
the means to realize that purpose; above all, it must have
a worthy motive, a best and highest reason for both purpose
and act; and must make all conform to and result
in a moral order in harmony with the blessedness and
worthy the approbation of the All-perfect One. Intuition
and choice, affection and conscience&mdash;these are the
grand momenta of personality.</p>

<p>The necessary demand of reason is that the first and
originative cause of all finite personality shall be Himself
a person. Consciousness can not arise out of unconsciousness,
reason can not be generated from unreason, personality
can not have its birth from impersonality, no more
than something can be born of nothing. There must be
intelligence answering to our intelligence, freedom answering
to our freedom, feeling responding to our feeling,
and moral sentiment unisonant with our moral sentiment:
in short, personality correlated with our personality,
in the cause and author of finite responsible being.
That perfection which is mirrored in our finite personality
exists in all its fullness in the unconditionally
perfect Being, the Perfect Personality whose name is
<span class="smcap">LOVE</span>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>


<p>God, then, is the Absolute, Infinite, and Perfect Being
in whom, by whom, and for whom the finite has existence
and consciousness. He is <i>the unconditioned, conditionating
Will</i>. The Divine Essence can not be apprehended
or expressed in a higher universal. This is the first
dim intuition of spontaneous reason, and the final goal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
all reflective thought. The Divine Being is He who is
before all, and who originates, destines, and conditions
all. The Biblical idea of the unconditioned Being is in
perfect harmony with the philosophical idea. In the language
of Scripture, "the Will of God" stands for the remotest,
inmost essence of the Godhead&mdash;a will which is
the absolute identity, the eternal co-inherence of reason,
power, and love. The Divine Will as efficient cause is
never dissociated from the Divine Will as the formal
cause and the final cause. That will is at once cause
and law and reason of all things. God "effectuates all
things according to the <i>counsel</i> (τὴν βουλὴν = deliberation,
purpose, design) of his own Will" (Eph. i. 11). And not
only according to the counsel, but "according to the <i>good
pleasure</i> (τὴν εὐδοκίαν = the benevolent affection) of his
own will" (ver. 5); a "good pleasure which He hath <span class="smcap">PURPOSED</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
(προέθετο) in Himself" (ver. 9). He "created all
things, and for his own <i>pleasure</i> (θέλημα = will) they are
and were created." Here "Will" is clearly more than
power, more than efficiency: it is thought or purpose; it
is reason or end; in a word, it is the identity and co-inherence
of reason, power, and love. The unconditioned
Will as revealed to us in Scripture is an <i>intelligent</i> Will&mdash;a
will that thinks, deliberates, counsels, designs; and it
is also a <i>benevolent</i> Will&mdash;a will that loves and delights
in and desires the good of being. And in thinking and
desiring it effectuates, for thinking and operating, desiring
and doing, are one with God. "He speaks and it is
done, He commands and it stands fast." Creation is a
speech of God, a language in which He reveals his
thoughts, his purposes, his benevolent designs, his will&mdash;that
is, Himself. Every revelation of God is the development
in us of the consciousness of the <span class="smcap">REAL BEING</span>
(τὸ ὄντως ὄν). All the proofs of the being of God&mdash;the
etiological, the cosmological, the teleological, and the
moral&mdash;are centred in the <i>ontological</i>: this is first and
last. And just as our consciousness of the indivisible
identical <span class="smcap">EGO</span> as the unity and co-inherence of reason,
feeling, and power is the exact arresting-point of psychological
science, beyond which thought can not pass,
so our intuition of the unconditioned <span class="smcap">BEING</span> as the absolute
identity of Reason, Power, and Love is the exact
arresting point of Theological science, beyond which
nothing can be known. Spirit, Light, Love&mdash;these designate
essence or being. "<span class="smcap">God is spirit</span>" (πνεῦμα = Spirit,
not a Spirit&mdash;John iv. 24), the self-moving, efficient,
animating principle, the unity and life-motion of the
creative divine activity; ἡ ζωὴ αἰώνιος&mdash;vita
absoluta&mdash;underived, eternal Life (John v. 26; xi. 25; 1 John v.
20). <span class="smcap">God is light</span> (1 John i. 5), the self-manifesting, intuitional,
revealing principle = ὁ λόγος; the Eternal Reason,
in which Spirit becomes objective to itself, and God
is revealed to Himself (John i. 1; 1 Tim. vi. 16). <span class="smcap">God is
love</span> (1 John iv. 8, 16), the self-complete, self-sufficient,
self-satisfying principle = τὸ τέλος, the Perfect One
(Matth. v. 48). This Divine Love finds its fullest satisfaction
in the κόσμος νοητός, the intelligible world as revealed
and rendered objective to Himself in "the <span class="smcap">WORD</span>."
Reason, Spirit, Love are the simplest elements in the conception
of the unconditioned Being: Reason as Reality,
Spirit as Efficiency, and Love as Perfection.</p>

<p>The unconditioned Being is revealed, may we not
say "incarnated,"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> in the κόσμος αἴσθησις&mdash;the sensible
world: 1, by the incarnation of the Spirit in the moving
and animating forces of nature; 2, by the incarnation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the Reason in the typical forms and permanent laws or
relations of the universe, by which reality becomes known
to finite minds; 3, by the incarnation of Love in the final
causes, the benevolent purposes, which are realized in the
completed Cosmos and the life of Humanity.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Attribute or Related Essence.</span> The knowledge
of the Divine Essence is the root of the knowledge of
the Divine Attributes, for in every conception of an attribute
the Divine Essence is, in some mode or other, supposed.
We may therefore define an attribute as a conception
of the unconditioned Being under some relation
to our consciousness. That conception may be either
positive or negative, and the relation may consequently
be one of causation or abstraction.</p>

<p>When we conceive of the Divine Essence as <i>reality</i>,
our conception is in some measure determined by our
consciousness of reality. The intuition of reality is immanent
to our own consciousness. We know self as a
reality, an indivisible, identical Ego&mdash;a unity, but yet a
conditioned and dependent reality, which must have its
ground and cause in an independent and unconditioned
reality. Thus the pure intuition of reality is a preluding
for the affirmation of absolute reality. We can not, however,
affirm such reality on purely subjective grounds.
To the eye of reason, which is the organ of necessary and
absolute truth, the Divine Essence abstracts itself from the
limits of space and time, and absolves itself from all the
determinations of objective being. It is a reality which is
not conditioned by <i>kind</i>, a reality which is independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of, absolved from, undetermined by any other antecedent
or contemporaneous being&mdash;absolute reality.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when we conceive the Divine Essence as
<i>power</i> or efficiency, our conception is in some measure
determined by our consciousness of power. We know
ourselves as a power, a cause of our own volitions, and a
power which can control and modify external nature, but
yet a limited and finite cause. To the eye of reason the
Divine efficiency transcends all limitation and mensuration.
It is a power which is not conditioned by <i>quantity</i>.
It is limitless power, spaceless, all-mighty presence, self-directive
power, carrying its own light and seeing its own
way&mdash;infinite efficiency.</p>

<p>And, finally, when we conceive of the Divine Essence
as <i>personality</i>, again our conception is in some measure
determined by our consciousness of personality. We are
conscious of desiring and purposing, of determining and
doing, of approving and delighting in our artistic and
ethical creations, and in these we stand out from the
plane of nature as persons and not things. But we are
also conscious of limitation and imperfection. We fall
short even of our own ideals; we feel we have unsatisfied
longings and daily wants. The Divine Essence reveals
itself to reason as exempt from all limitation by <i>degree</i>.
"Pure personality is no more limited than absolute
being, but it is deeper by all the contents of perfect
consciousness." It is a personality which has no defect
and no want: unconditioned, unlimited perfection&mdash;perfect
personality.</p>

<p>Our conception of the Attributes of God may thus be
formed through some relation to our consciousness, but
by a process of immediate abstraction&mdash;the negation of
all limitation by kind, by quantity, or by degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>1. As related to our intuition of real being; by abstraction
from all other being and personality&mdash;the <i>Immanent</i>
attributes of God.</p>

<p>2. As causally related to finite, dependent existence;
by elimination of all necessary limitation&mdash;the <i>Relative
or Transitive</i> attributes of God.</p>

<p>3. As ethically related to finite personality; by elimination
of all imperfection&mdash;the <i>Moral</i> attributes of
God.</p>


<p>1. <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">IMMANENT</span> <i>attributes</i>. The absolute reality (<span class="smcap">REASON</span>)
must necessarily be conceived as First, Supreme, and
Sole; must be underived, and therefore eternal; must be
absolved from all necessary relation to other being, and
therefore independent; must be above all law of change,
and therefore immutable; must have incomposite unity,
and therefore indivisible; and must be the only one, for
two absolutes would limit each other, and are thus inconceivable.
Finally, absolute reality must be the fullness
and archetype of all being in which every form and
every relation, every totality and every harmony, conceivable
or possible, must be ideally and eternally present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eternity</span> (1 Tim. i. 17; vi. 15, 16; Rev. i. 4, 8; Heb.
i. 8).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Immutability</span> (James i. 17; Psalm cii. 26, 27; Heb.
i. 12).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unity</span> (Isaiah xliv. 6; Eph. iv. 6; 1 Tim. ii. 5; John
xvii. 3).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ideality</span> (Psalm cxxxix. 16; Rom. xi. 36; Acts xv.
18).</p>

<p>These are the immanent attributes of God.</p>


<p>2. <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">TRANSITIVE OR RELATIVE</span> <i>attributes</i>. The In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>finite
Efficiency (<span class="smcap">SPIRIT</span>) must necessarily be conceived as
all-mighty, all-present, and all-knowing. The Infinite
Spirit fills, penetrates, moves, and vitalizes the universe.
He is in all, and through all, and transcends all. He can
not be bounded in space or limited in power, therefore He
is spaceless and infinite. "He is every where present, not
virtually but substantially, for virtue can not subsist without
substance." And as the All-mighty is present every
where, present to all things, so all things exist "in Him,"
and are present to Him in an immediate and intuitive vision&mdash;He
knows all things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omnipotence</span> (Psalm cxv. 3; Jer. xxxii. 27; Rom. xi. 36;
1 Cor. viii. 6).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ubiquity</span> (Psalm cxxxix. 7-13; Jer. xxiii. 23, 24; 1 Cor.
xv. 28; Matth. x. 29).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omniscience</span> (Psalm cxxxix. 1-6; Acts i. 24; Heb. iv.
13; Matth. vi. 8).</p>

<p>These are the relative or transitive attributes of God.</p>


<p>3. <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">MORAL</span> <i>attributes</i>. Perfect Personality (<span class="smcap">LOVE</span>)
must by the very conception be wise and holy, righteous
and blessed, for these are the attributes of personality, and
may all be ultimately grounded in love. The reason of
all existence and all personality is found, not in infinite
causality, but in the free love of the perfect personality.
This is the final cause of all existence. And if perfect
Love be the final cause of all existence, it must know the
end, and ordain the law and means. The highest end of
the world is the perfect fellowship of man with God; the
physical must therefore be subordinated to the moral order
of the universe. The Perfect Personality must freely
will to impart his fellowship to those who are obedient to
his moral law; and it must be removed from fellowship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
with and deny itself to evil, which is antagonistic to the
ends of Love. Or, in other words, it must establish a fixed
and changeless relation between righteousness and
blessedness in the creature. It must approve the good
and condemn the evil. And in making the righteous
"partakers of his joy," He must be "well pleased." The
absolute blessedness of God is found in the fullness and
harmony of the Divine life. He has in Himself the eternal
and absolutely worthy object of his love. But there
is a Divine satisfaction, "a good pleasure of God," which
is found in the communication of Himself to the creature.
"He rejoiceth in the habitable parts of the earth, and his
delights are with the sons of men." "He taketh pleasure
in them that fear Him, in those that hope in his mercy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wisdom</span> (Job xii. 13; Rom. xi. 33, 34; Eph. iii. 9, 10).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blessedness</span> (1 Tim. i. 11; vi. 15).</p>

<p>These are the moral attributes of God.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> They are also
called by pre-eminence the Perfections of God, because
they are free determinations of the Divine nature, an
everlasting "<span class="smcap">BECOMING</span>," rather than an eternal "<span class="smcap">BEING</span>."
The immanent attributes of God are a necessary inbeing;
the moral attributes of God are a voluntary outgoing, an
eternally free, alternative forth-putting of choice for the
right and the good.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine concerning God above presented, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
we fain would hope that philosophy and Christian thought
are brought into harmony, may now be summarily presented
in the following schema:</p>

<pre>
  Fundamental Idea of Reason.      Thought-Conceptions
                                 Founded on Relations.

                                 {BLESSEDNESS }
</pre>

<p>The references to the Sacred Scriptures already given
will show the harmony between the conceptions of
reason and the verbal revelations of God. Reason and
Scripture unite in proclaiming that God is "the great and
holy <i>One</i> that inhabiteth eternity," who "only hath immortality,"
"with whom is no variableness," and who
"filleth all in all;" to whom "all his works are known
from eternity," in whose book "all our members were written
when as yet there was none of them," and whose
"purposes," ideas, and plans are "eternal." These are
mainly the immanent attributes of God, conceptions which
flow from the very idea of the Absolute and Infinite Being.
They are evolved from Real Being by the negation
of all limit, all parts, all change; the canceling of time
and space and matter, the recognition of God as pure
Reason, pure Spirit, pure Love.</p>

<p>The Scriptures, however, deal more immediately with
the causal, transitive, and relational aspects of the Divine
attributes&mdash;that is, with the conception of God in his vol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>untary
relations to finite being and finite personality.
They speak of God in his historically known existence, as
a Being who <i>voluntarily</i> conditions his Omnipotence and
Sovereignty under concessions of self-reality, self-life, and
freedom to finite beings, without Himself being conditioned
by any thing&mdash;a <i>self-limitation</i> which in nowise detracts
from the absoluteness and infinity of God&mdash;an <i>unconditioned
conditionating Will</i>.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The relation which God sustains to his works is not a
<i>necessary</i> relation&mdash;it is a <i>voluntary</i> and self-imposed relation.
Free Love is the highest determining principle for
the efficiency of Divine Omnipotence. Power thus directed
and conditioned by wisdom and love does not, can
not detract from the perfection of God. The substitution
of <i>choice</i> for necessity is, in fact, no real limitation;
on the contrary, it ascribes to God the most <i>absolute perfection</i>.</p>

<p>The causal attributes of God, or those conceptions of
God which are especially grounded upon his relation to
the world and humanity, are properly divided into those
which are Cosmical and those which are Ethical. The
first, of course, embrace his relation to the world, the second
his relation to personal, responsible beings. The content
of the cosmological conception is Omnipotence,
Ubiquity, Omniscience. The content of the ethical conception
is Wisdom, Goodness, Holiness, and Blessedness.
God as the Creator and Sustainer of the world, God as
the Father, Teacher, and Ruler of humanity, are the two
grand manifestations of the one infinite and perfect Being,
and "<i>Elohim</i>" and "<i>Jehovah</i>" are his expressive and
distinctive names, the first denoting the cosmical activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of God, the latter his government and kingdom among
men.</p>

<p>These two grand aspects of the Divine manifestation
are marked in the Elohistic and Jehovistic portions of the
first revelation given to the Semitic race. They are still
more distinctly recognized in Paul's discourse before the
assembled Athenian philosophers, where Christian theology
was for the first time presented to the Greek mind&mdash;God
the Creator and Conservator of the world (Acts
xvii. 24, 25); God the Father, Teacher, Ruler, and Judge
of humanity (Acts xvii. 26-31).</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br/>
THE CREATION.</h2>


<p>God is the Absolute, Infinite, and Perfect Being, in
whom, through whom, and for whom are all things. This
is the Christian conception of God; and it is the only
conception which furnishes an adequate and satisfactory
explanation of all the facts of the universe. Here we
have a First Principle, an Originative Cause which is sufficient
to account for all existence.</p>

<p>But what conception are we to form of the nature and
mode of this Origination? Was it a pure, supernatural
Origination, an absolute Creation? or was it simply a formation
out of a first substance existing coeval with and
independent of God? Was that act of creation determined
by necessity? was it an unconscious emanation
from, or a necessary development of that First Principle?
Or was it a conscious, free exertion of power
for the realization of a foreseen and predetermined plan&mdash;a
mental Order? What is the Biblical conception of
Creation? This is the question we must now endeavor to
answer.</p>

<p>Until very recently it has been the practice of theologians
to attempt the determination of the Biblical notion
of Creation on purely philological grounds. It is now
generally conceded that this method is inadequate and inconclusive.
The Greeks probably never conceived the
idea of an absolute creation (commonly, though we judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
incorrectly, styled creation <i>ex nihilo</i>), and consequently
the Greek language has no terms expressive of a primal
origination, an absolute beginning of the world. Ποιεῖν,
the term employed in the LXX. (Gen. i. 1), and also by
St. Paul (Acts xvii. 24), means to endow with a certain
quality (ποῖος = <i>qualis</i>)&mdash;to construct, make, form, build,
and evidently conveys the notion of <i>formation</i> rather than
<i>origination</i>, the production of qualitative phenomena
rather than real entity; κτίζειν is also ordinarily used in
the sense of forming, fashioning, building, and seems to
imply pre-existing materials.</p>

<p>There is also a wide difference of opinion among Oriental
scholars with respect to the precise import of the
verbs בָּרָא (bara), עָשָׂה (aysah), and יִצֶר (yetsar), as employed
in the Hebrew Scriptures. Some distinguished
critics, as Parkhurst, Clarke, Lange, and Delitzsch, assert
that בָּרָא means to originate <i>de novo</i>, to create in an absolute
sense; and that עָשָׂה and יִצֶר strictly mean to fashion
out of pre-existent materials.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But Pusey, Kitto,
Tayler Lewis, and some of the Rabbinical commentators
(Aben Ezra especially), affirm that בָּרָא, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by its etymology and its connections, indicates <i>formation</i>
as much as origination, and is, in fact, indifferent and
neutral either as to a supposed creation <i>ex nihilo</i>, or a
creation, that is, a formation from pre-existing materials.
Furthermore, it is affirmed that the three Hebrew verbs
are used indiscriminately in the Mosaic record. It is said
in Gen. i. 27 that God created בָּרָא man, and that statement
is amplified and explained at ch. ii. 7: "And
the Lord God formed עָשָׂה man <i>out of the dust of the
earth</i>."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> An appeal to the merely verbal expressions of
Scripture does not, therefore, promise any satisfactory and
conclusive results.</p>

<p>By what method, then, are we to determine the Biblical
notion of Creation? Clearly, not by a critical study of
the several words which are employed to express the
creative act&mdash;not by confining our attention to the visible
embodiment of the Divine word, and neglecting the informing
thought. We must ground our conception of
creation upon the fundamental ideas and principles of
Divine revelation, and determine it in harmony with the
Christian idea of God, and the Christian doctrine of the
relation of the world to God.</p>

<p>These fundamental principles we have already presented.
They may be succinctly restated in the following
propositions:</p>

<p>(1.) God is the one only self-existent, independent, unconditioned
Being, "who alone hath immortality," "the
incorruptible or immutable God" (ἀφθάρτος Θεός), "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
whom is no variableness or shadow of change."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> (2.) God
is the sole causality of the heavens and the earth, in the
most absolute sense. Whatever is, and is not God, is the
creature of God. "By Him were all things created which
are in heaven and which are upon earth, things visible
and things invisible"&mdash;the objects of sense-perception and
of rational intuition. The origin, development, and end,
the principle, law, and reason of all existence, are in God
and from God&mdash;πάντα ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐν τῷ Θεῷ, εἰς τὸν
Θεόν.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
(3.) The all of the finite is in ceaseless and complete dependence
on the Divine causality&mdash;"He upholdeth all
things," and "by Him all things consist."</p>

<p>Our interpretation of the formal language of Scripture,
especially of the verbs which are employed to denote the
act of creation, must therefore be informed and determined
by these fundamental principles. If God is the
unconditioned Cause of all existence, then the Creation
must be the absolutely <i>free</i> and self-determined act of
God. As such, it can not have been conditioned by any
immanent necessity in the Divine nature itself, nor by
any necessary existence out of and extraneous to the Divine
nature. By this conception of God, and of his relation
to the world, we are debarred from supposing the
coeval existence of any thing besides God (<i>e. g.</i>, ἄπειρον, τὸ μὴ ὄν of Plato, the ὕλη of Aristotle, the "matter" of the
modern Physicist) as the condition and medium of the
Divine agency and manifestation. While, therefore, it is
acknowledged that in Gen. i. 21, 27, בָּרָא (bara) denotes
the <i>formation</i> of organic bodies out of pre-existent materials,
we can not be restricted to this meaning of the
term when dealing with verse 1, "In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth." We are compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to believe that "bara" here means <i>origination</i>&mdash;origination
<i>de novo</i>; first, because the primal act of creation
must have been a supernatural, miraculous production of
something which had not previously existed under any
form&mdash;an unconditioned creation antecedent to nature;
and, secondly, because we are informed that after this
primal act of creation, "the earth was still <i>without form</i>
and void." No possible ingenuity of criticism can construe
that opening sentence of revelation to mean, "In the
beginning God gave <i>form</i> to pre-existing matter." That
first beginning is the <i>principium principiorum</i>, the beginning
of all beginnings, and must be distinguished from
the six new beginnings of the six days' work.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> We must
regard this sublime utterance, standing at the head of all
God's communications, as affirming this foundation-idea
of revelation&mdash;that God is the sole causality of the heavens
and the earth in an absolute sense, the efficient cause
of time, and all temporal relations; the all-mighty cause
of space, and all spatial relations; the originator of the
primordial substance, and all its qualities&mdash;in a word, the
unconditioned Creator of all finite being, quality, and relation&mdash;"בְּרֵאשִית&mdash;ἐν ἀρχῆ&mdash;<i>in principio</i>&mdash;first of all (in
the order of conception rather than the order of time)
God originated, laid the foundations of, the heavens and
the earth."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>And now that the Creation here affirmed was an absolute
origination, a bringing into being of the primordial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
elements out of which the heavens and the earth were subsequently
"formed," is the doctrine of the best Hebrew
lexicographers. It is held by many of the best authorities
that the particle אֵת (ayth) means "the very substance
of," "the very or real essence." Fürst, in his recently
published Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon, gives "being,
essence, substance," as the meaning of "ayth." Gesenius,
in his Hebrew Grammar, says "'ayth' means being,
substance" (p. 216). And furthermore, he says "'<i>ayth</i>'
is a substantive derived from a pronominal stem, and signifies
essence, substance, being." "The particle '<i>ayth</i>,'"
says Aben Ezra, "signifies the substance of a thing."
Kimchi, in his famous "Book of Hebrew Roots," gives
a similar definition. In the Syriac version, "<i>yoth</i>"
takes the place of "<i>ayth</i>," and is very appropriately rendered
in Walton's Polyglot, "<i>esse coeli et esse terræ</i>"&mdash;the
being or substance of the heavens and the earth. It
is not, therefore, a fanciful and altogether unauthorized
reading of this opening sentence of Divine revelation
which the Christian idea of God, and of his relation to
the world, seems to demand&mdash;"<i>In the beginning God
originated, brought into being, the primordial elements
of the heavens and the earth.</i>"</p>


<p>For manageable clearness, in dealing with the Mosaic
primeval history, we shall find ourselves under the necessity
of accepting the distinction made by theologians
between <i>creatio prima, immediata</i>, and <i>creatio mediata,
formativa</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>An absolute Creation</i>, a pure supernatural origination&mdash;the
Beginning of all beginnings.</p>

<p>2. <i>An artistic, architectonic Creation</i>, a supernatural
formation out of a first substance&mdash;the production of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
things or beings by aggregation, organization, and development
according to pre-established laws and archetypal
ideas.</p>

<p>The first notion of Creation is grounded on the Omnipotence
of God, the second on the Infinite Wisdom of God,
and both are united in and ultimately grounded on the
unconditioned Will.</p>


<p>And now let us confine our attention to the first conception
of Creation&mdash;<i>creatio prima, immediata</i>, or <span class="smcap">ABSOLUTE
CREATION</span>.</p>

<p>The fundamental Theistic conception which lies at the
very root of the Biblical doctrine of Creation, and clearly
distinguishes it from all Materialistic, Pantheistic, and
Dualistic notions of the origin of the world, is that God
is the <i>Absolute Personality</i>&mdash;the eternally self-conscious,
self-complete, self-sufficient Being, all the determinations
of whose <i>nature</i> and <i>action</i> are grounded in his absolute
Will. The Divine essence, in its inmost, deepest ground,
is not determined being, but <i>unlimited power of self-determination</i>.
The primitive, root idea of the Godhead is
an <i>ever-living, unconditioned Will</i>&mdash;an unconditioned
Will as the indivisible unity and perpetual differentiation
of <i>reason</i> and <i>power</i>, a will which realizes itself in self-affirmation
(<span class="smcap">IPSËITY</span>); manifests itself in self-determination
and choice (<span class="smcap">ALTERITY</span>); and completes itself in the actualization
of a final purpose (<span class="smcap">PERFECTION</span>).<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The <i>nature</i> of
God, as distinct from his <i>essence</i>, is absolutely his own
act.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> God, as the manifested God, is what He is by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
own determination and choice. God is just, because He
wills to be just; God is holy, because He wills to be holy;
God is good, because He wills to be good, and not from
any constraining, immanent necessity, otherwise He could
not be the object of praise, adoration, and love. If God
is not good by virtue of his own determination and choice,
then there is nothing praiseworthy and adorable in his
nature, and all the thanksgiving of sacred psalmody is
meaningless; worship is groundless, religion has no significance,
and love to God is impossible. A necessitated
goodness can no more command our moral esteem than
the uniform revolution of the planetary orbs, and where
there is no moral esteem, there can be no love, no worship,
and no praise.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>If, then, God is a personal Being, the Absolute Personality,
another being can not proceed from Him except in
virtue of his own free determination. <i>Creation must
therefore be a</i> <span class="smcap">VOLUNTARY</span> <i>act</i>.</p>

<p>And for the full comprehension of this fundamental
principle, we must remember that volition is something
more than a simple efflux of power, something more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a mere developing tendency&mdash;an evolution or process
without motive and without design. A voluntary act is
a designed, an <i>intentional</i> act, the act of a being who can
previously contemplate the act in thought, who can have
a reason or motive for the doing of the act, and who can
determine and condition the deed. This conception of
creation as a voluntary act is unmistakably presented in
the oft-repeated language of the Mosaic record, "God
said, <i>Let there be&mdash;and there was!</i>" "The speaking of
God most certainly indicates the thinking of God, and it
thence follows that all the works of creation are <i>thoughts</i>
of God (idealism). But it indicates also a will making itself
externally known, an active operation of God; and
thence it follows that all the works of creation are <i>deeds</i>
of God (realism). Thinking and operating, however, are
one in the Divine speaking, the primal source of language&mdash;his
personality making Himself known (personalism)....
Through creating, speaking, making, forming, the
world is ever and again denoted as the <i>free deed</i> of God."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Furthermore, creation is a voluntary act in the most absolute
sense&mdash;that is, it is an act of God to which He was
not determined by any <i>inherent</i> necessity or want of his
own nature, and an act which was not conditioned, in a
necessary manner, by any thing out of, distinct from, and
extraneous to the Divine nature.</p>

<p>1. <i>Creation was an act of God to which He was not determined
by any inherent necessity or want of his own
nature.</i></p>

<p>If God is the eternally self-conscious, self-complete, and
self-sufficient Being, He is under no necessity to create
other beings in order to realize perfect self-consciousness,
or to secure his own perfect blessedness. He does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
need "otherness"&mdash;that which is not Himself&mdash;in order to
become manifest to Himself; neither does He "crave beings
not Himself"<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in order to his complete felicity. The
antithesis of self and non-self&mdash;the <i>ego</i> and the <i>non-ego</i>&mdash;may
be a necessary condition of finite personality, but it
can not be a necessary condition of Absolute Personality.
God is eternally revealed to Himself in an unconditioned
manner as self-conscious Love, self-conscious Reason, self-conscious
Energy&mdash;the Father, the Word, the Spirit; and
He is from all eternity "the ever-blessed God," who has
in the Divine Triunity the eternal and absolutely worthy
object of his Love, independent of every relation to the
world and humanity&mdash;"Thou lovedst Me <i>before</i> the foundation
of the world" (John xvii. 24), "before the world
was" (ver. 5).<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>If, then, creation be the act of an Absolute Personality,
the act of a Being who freely and unconditionally determines
his own nature and conditionates all existence, then
<i>the Will of God is the sole causality of the world</i>, and in
his Will alone we have the unlimited, infinite ground-principle
of all reality. Absolute Personality tolerates no other
transition from the idea of God to the idea of the world
than that of a Will which freely conditions itself by
Love. This Free Love is the highest determining principle
for the Divine efficiency. Therefore, in order to derive
the essential existence of the world from God, the
Scriptures postulate nothing beside or beyond an ever-living,
intelligent Will which has its reason or motive, but
not its necessitating cause, in Love&mdash;"<i>the benevolence</i>
(εὐδοκία) <i>of his Will</i>" (Eph. i. 5). The Creation is nothing
else than the free self-communication of God, who is Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>self
eternally self-complete and self-sufficient, but who
from love alone wills that other beings shall have existence
and, in fellowship with Him, eternal life.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It is only by holding fast to these principles in all their
integrity that we can escape the seductions of Pantheism,
that perpetual temptation of metaphysical minds. The
fundamental idea of Pantheism is "an indeterminate principle
which is <i>necessarily</i> determined to become successively
every thing. Absolute necessity is the beginning,
middle, and end."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> We can escape its iron grasp only by
distinctly recognizing and firmly holding the Absolute
Personality of God&mdash;that is, by affirming a perfect self-consciousness
which is not conditioned by an antithetical
not-self; a perfect self-determination which is not conditioned
by an antecedent <i>natura naturans</i>; and a perfect
self-sufficiency which knows no want. The first affirmation
rejects the dialectical necessity of Hegel, the
second excludes the mathematical necessity of Spinoza,
the third cancels the metaphysical necessity of Cousin.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>Creation as the free act of God was not conditioned
by any thing out of and foreign to the Divine nature.</i></p>

<p>A moment's reflection will suffice to convince us that a
<i>limitation posited from without</i> would be as fatal to the
idea of God as a supposed inherent necessity determining
the Divine causality from within. The idea of God as
the Being who is absolutely self-grounded, self-sufficient,
and self-determined, equally excludes both. If God is
the sole causality of the heavens and the earth in an absolute
sense&mdash;the efficient cause of time and all temporal
succession&mdash;the all-mighty cause of space, and of all spatial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
relations&mdash;the sole originator of the primordial substance,
and of all its qualities, then the creative act can not have
been conditioned by <i>Time</i> or <i>Space</i> or <i>Matter</i>.</p>

<p>In his otherwise admirable essay on "Nature and God,"
Mr. Martineau asserts that we can have no conception of
even the possibility of a creation except on the assumption
of the coeval existence of something objective to
God as the condition and medium of the Divine agency
and manifestation. He therefore affirms the coeval and
co-eternal existence of <i>Space</i> and <i>Matter</i>, <i>Time</i> and <i>Number</i>,
"with Him, and yet independent of Him."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The
idea of God's "<i>supplying Himself</i> with objectivity" is,
in his judgment, "discredited by modern science." The
creative act must therefore have been conditioned by something
other than God, and independent of God.</p>

<p>Now it must be obvious to every thoughtful mind that
this assumption tends to the invalidation of every proof
of the existence of God. If it can be shown that any one
thing exists aside from and independent of God&mdash;that any
thing exists which was not created by God&mdash;then may we
claim equal independence for every other thing, and He
who claims to be the Creator of <i>all</i> things is discredited.
As Herbert Spencer urges, with great force, "If we admit
that there can be something uncaused, there is no reason
to assume a cause for any thing."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> With what reason
can we say that some things do exist that never were
created, but others can not so exist? If substances are
eternal, why not attributes? If matter is self-existent, why
not force? If space is independent, why not form? And
if we concede the eternity of matter and force, why not
admit the eternity of law&mdash;that is, uniformity of relations?
And if so much is granted, why not also grant that a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>sequent
order of the universe is also eternal? If we admit
that any thing besides God is self-existent, that any
thing exists independent of God as "the <i>condition</i> of the
Divine agency and manifestation," then God is not the
unconditioned Absolute Being. "A limitation posited
from without directly destroys the idea of God, for it contradicts
the idea of the Absolute."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Martineau admits that the assumption of "the coeval
existence of matter as the condition and medium of
the Divine agency" "rests on quite other grounds than
those which support our belief respecting space."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> We
can conceive the non-existence of matter, but we can not
conceive the non-existence of space. The idea of space is
absolutely necessary, therefore "no one asks a cause for
the space of the universe."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In making this assertion,
however, Mr. Martineau betrays some want of acquaintance
with the history of the philosophy of space and time.
Many able and thoroughly philosophic minds have "asked
a cause," and have assigned a cause for "the space of the
universe." Sir Isaac Newton held that "God endures always
and is present every where, and by existing always
and every where <i>constitutes</i> duration and space."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This
doctrine, thus generally stated, is held by Saisset to be incontestible.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
McCosh also believes that time and space
are not independent of God: "I am not necessarily
obliged to believe that the infinity of space and time is
independent of the infinity of God.... Who will venture
to affirm that space and time, being dependent on God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
may not stand in some relation to God which is altogether
indefinable and utterly incomprehensible by us."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Finally,
Schleiermacher and Nitzsch do not hesitate to teach
that "God is the all-mighty cause of space" and "the
efficient cause of time."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The question whether the idea of space is conditionally
or unconditionally necessary can only be determined by
the solution of the deeper question whether space is a real
entity or a relation. If space is a real entity, it must have
properties or attributes, but what philosopher of any reputation
has ever attempted to set down the properties or
attributes of space? They who assert that space is an uncreated,
independent, and indestructible entity, ought to
be able to define it and tell <i>what</i> it is. Dr. Porter tells
us that space can not be defined, "We can not form a
concept of this <i>entity</i> by means of generalized attributes
or relations."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Can that be for us an entity of which we
can form no concept, and which we can not determine in
thought by any attribute or relation? The writer of the
article on "The Philosophy of Time and Space," in the
<i>North American Review</i>,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> is an earnest defender of the
objective reality of space as an independent and indestructible
entity, and he has defined and analyzed the concept.
"Space is <i>absolute vacuity</i>" (p. 91). "The idea of
space is a triple synthesis ... of three <i>negative</i> notions&mdash;receptivity,
unity, and infinity; the first is the negation of
matter, the second is the negation of divisibility, the third
is the negation of limitation" (p. 95). Do these words
convey any knowledge? Absolute vacuity is void, empty,
inane. Absolute vacuity is pure nothing, and of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
there is nothing to be divided and nothing to be limited.
Absolute vacuity is a negation, and unity and infinity are
negations of a negation&mdash;that is, they are predicates of
nothing. "Negative notions" must be predicates of <i>something</i>,
otherwise they are a mere negation or absence of
thought, and convey absolutely no knowledge. We may,
if we please, assert with Hegel, that "Nothing is the same
as Being," and then amuse ourselves with making affirmations
concerning vacuity, nihility, and unreality to the disgrace
of philosophy; but the common-sense of mankind
will repudiate our absurdities. We can not think about
nothing; all thought must be positive. Thought must
have an object, and that object must be either an entity,
or the attribute of an entity, or a relation between entities.</p>

<p>If pure space is regarded as "<i>absolute vacuity</i>"&mdash;pure
nothing&mdash;then we may readily dispose of the argument
on which Prof. Stewart relies with so much confidence.
"Divine omnipotence can not annihilate space,"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> therefore
it must be an independent reality. We have simply
to answer&mdash;the notion of annihilating nihility is an absurdity
and a contradiction. There is nothing to be annihilated,
and Omnipotence even must be inadequate to
the annihilation of nothing.</p>

<p>If, with Leibnitz, Lord Monboddo, Calderwood, and
many modern physicists,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> we reject the notion of "abso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>lute
vacuity"&mdash;infinite space&mdash;and regard space as a <i>relation</i>&mdash;the
relation of position, distance, direction&mdash;then,
like all the quantitive relations of mathematics, it may be
regarded as conditionally necessary&mdash;that is, bodies being
given, they must necessarily have place, distance, and direction.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Space as a necessary relation is a reality, but a
reality which is conditioned and conditional, and "God is
the all-mighty cause of space." If all bodies were annihilated,
there would be no position, no distance, no direction,
and consequently space would be annihilated. There
would remain nothing but the timeless, spaceless, Infinite
One, who is the efficient cause of all existence, all qualities,
and all relations. This, again, would be a sufficient
answer to the sophism of Dr. Clark, quoted and indorsed
by Stewart&mdash;"God can not annihilate the space in this
room!" Annihilate the room, and the relative space in
the room is no more&mdash;that is, the distance between the inclosing
walls. Of "pure space" apart from the relations
of bodies we have no conception, can have no conception;
for to annihilate all bodies, in thought, we must annihilate
our own body, and to a disembodied spirit there can be
no <i>here</i> and no <i>there</i>. Place is a relation belonging to
extension, and extension is a property of matter only.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>There has been so much confusion of thought generated
by the mere word-jugglery of philosophers in the use of
the terms <i>time</i> and <i>space</i>, <i>duration</i> and <i>extension</i>, <i>eternity</i>
and <i>immensity</i>, that a revision of the whole terminology
in the interest of true science is demanded. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
perilous to launch out upon this ocean of equivocal phraseology,
called the philosophy of time and space, before taking
our bearings, amid notions so closely related, yet so
dissimilar, and endeavoring to fix some definite meaning
to these terms, which, like points of the compass, shall enable
us to find our position.</p>

<p>1. <i>Let us commence our effort with</i> <span class="smcap">SPACE</span>, <span class="smcap">EXTENSION</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">IMMENSITY</span>. Some philosophers&mdash;Cousin,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Hamilton,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Spencer,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> McCosh,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> for example&mdash;confound <i>space</i> and <i>extension</i>,
and all of them confound both with absolute <i>immensity</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Now if space is identical with extension, it must be cognized
by the senses and the sensuous imagination. This is
unhesitatingly affirmed by Hamilton: "We <i>see</i> extension,"
and "by the name extension we designate our empirical
knowledge of space."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> So also McCosh: "Of space in the
concrete we have an immediate knowledge by the senses,
certainly by some of them, such as the touch and sight."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Space in this connection can not therefore be regarded as
an <i>à priori</i> cognition. It is equally obvious that if space
is identical with extension, it must have color and form.
This also is admitted by Hamilton: "I can easily annihilate
all corporeal existence [in imagination]. I can im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>agine
<i>empty</i> space. But there are two attributes of which
I can not divest it&mdash;that is, shape and color."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Now if
space has "shape," that is, figure, it must have dimensions,
and accordingly we find almost all philosophers speaking of
the three dimensions of space&mdash;length, breadth, and depth.
That which has length, breadth, and depth must be divisible,
must have parts and proportions, must have susceptibilities
of exact measurement, and therefore must be
<i>finite</i>. This again is the doctrine of Hamilton: "Space is
finite, and a finite, that is, a bounded space constitutes
a figure"&mdash;a sphere.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The fundamental doctrine of
Hamilton is that "space, like time, is only the intuition
or the concept of a certain correlation of existence&mdash;of
existence, therefore, <i>pro tanto</i>, <i>as conditioned</i>. <i>It is thus
itself only a form of the conditioned.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> But if space be
only a correlation of conditioned, and therefore finite existence,
how can he speak of it "being conceived as infinite,"<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
and, above all, how can he speak of "the absolute
totality" and "the infinite immensity of space."</p>

<p>McCosh, also, though evidently with some hesitation,
teaches that "we can conceive <i>proportion</i> in space, and
if we take any of these proportional sections, and divide
it into two, thought will compel us to say that the two
make up the whole. In this sense the <i>parts</i> make up the
whole&mdash;that is, the subsections make up the section. If
the question be extended beyond this, and it be asked, Is
infinite space made up of parts? I answer, that as we
can have no adequate notion of infinite space, so we can
not be expected to answer all the questions which may be
put regarding it. <i>It is certain that neither infinite space
nor finite space is made up of separate parts.</i> We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
speak intelligibly of <i>proportions</i> in finite space, and determine
their relations to each other and the whole. I
tremble to speak of the proportions of infinite space, lest
I be using language which has or can have no proper
meaning, and the signification attached to which by me
or others might be altogether inapplicable to such a subject.
Still there are propositions which we might intelligibly
use. It is self-evident that <i>any proportion of space
must be less than infinite space</i>. And if infinite space
can be conceived as having <i>proportions</i>, and we could
conceive all these proportions, then these proportions
would be equal to the <i>whole</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Well may the author
say that he is "in a region dark and pathless;" for the
language here employed "can have no proper meaning"
in regard to infinite space. Well may he "tremble to
speak of <i>the proportions of infinite space</i>," for what can
proportion (<i>pro</i>, for <i>portio</i>, a part) mean except a numerical
relation of parts? Proportions&mdash;numerical relations&mdash;are
measurable quantities, therefore finite quantities,
and no addition of finite quantities, can make the infinite.
What confusion and contradiction is here wrought
by this word-jugglery with "the whole and parts" of
space!</p>

<p>Cousin, also, falls into the same inaccuracy and confusion.
He tells us that "human reason can conceive of
a space determined and limited,"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> therefore divisible,
measurable, and <i>finite</i>; and yet at the same time he
teaches that "space is illimitable, absolutely continuous,
an indivisible unity."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>And now let us note the contradictions which flow
from this confounding of space with extension, and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
with immensity. Space is cognized <i>à posteriori</i>, space is
cognized <i>à priori</i>. Space has parts and proportions, space
has no parts or proportions. Space is divisible, space is
indivisible&mdash;an absolute unity. Space is finite, space is
infinite. Space is susceptible of exact measurement, space
is immeasurable&mdash;that is, absolute immensity.</p>

<p>Space and extension are not identical. Extension is
simply an attribute of body&mdash;the continuity of matter.
Space is place, distance, direction, relations of bodies.
<i>Space is a certain correlation of finite existences.</i> Immensity
is the attribute of the unconditioned Being, the
absolute Spirit&mdash;that is, God. He is incorporeal, boundless,
spaceless, infinite.</p>


<p>2. The same confusion pervades the writings of philosophers
in regard to <span class="smcap">TIME</span>, <span class="smcap">DURATION</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">ETERNITY</span>.</p>

<p>Succession is confounded with duration,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> duration with
time,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and time with eternity.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>If succession and duration are identical, then, there is
no permanent substance underlying the fugitive phenomena
of the outer world, and no personal existence which
remains the same through all the changes of our mental
states. The human mind is simply "a series of feelings,"
a succession of mental states without any enduring ground
principle constituting our personal identity, and we are
thus landed in the constructive Idealism of John Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Mill.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> On the other hand, if there be a permanent substance
or essence underlying all mental phenomena, whose
continuance in existence is measured by phenomenal
change, time succession, then duration can not be identical
with time, any more than permanence can be the
same as change. With finite duration there is necessarily
given change; the past is like the future&mdash;always a minus
in relation to the present.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if time is synonymous with eternity, then
eternity is divisible, measurable, it has limits and parts.
Time, say the philosophers, has one dimension, while space
has three. "We," says McCosh, "represent time as a
line,"<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> it must therefore be divisible, and, if divisible, it
is legitimate to speak, with Hamilton, of "time and its
parts." "Time has succession, or priority and posteriority."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
And yet this same writer in the same work tells
us, "Time has no limits," and "Time can not be divided
into separable parts."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> If time and eternity are identical,
eternity has a past, a present, and a future&mdash;"eternity <i>ab
ante</i> and eternity <i>a post</i>."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The eternity past is bounded
by the present, it <i>ends</i> now; the eternity to come <i>begins</i>
now. We may with propriety ask, How can that which
has succession, which is capable of exact measurement,
which has a beginning and an end, be infinite? That
which had a beginning can not be unbeginning, that
which will come to an end can not be endless. Is not
the "eternity of <i>time</i>" a contradiction in terms? Is not
"absolute time" an absurdity?</p>

<p>Mark, then, the contradictions which flow from the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>founding
of succession and duration, time and eternity.
Time has limits, time has no limits. Time is divisible,
time is indivisible. Time is finite, time is infinite. Time
is relative, time is absolute. Time is moving, "it flows;"
time is immovable, "it does not flow."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Duration and succession, eternity and time, are not
identical. Duration is the continuance in existence of
finite creatures, a continuance which is measured by the
equable motion of planetary orbs, and imperfectly by
phenomenal changes in our mental states. Succession is
simply an order of phenomena, the recurrence, at regular
or irregular intervals, of like changes, or the series of different
states in the same existence. <i>Time is a certain
correlation of successive existences.</i> Eternity is an attribute
of the absolute Being&mdash;the <i>timelessness</i> of God. He
is not subject to the law of change, and therefore not to
the law of time, therefore his absolute being can not be
measured by successive epochs.</p>

<p>Let us now endeavor to dismiss from our thought all
this perplexing necromancy of words, and humbly pray,
with Themistocles, for "some sweet voluptuous art of forgetting."
Let us fix our mental gaze upon the <i>objects</i> of
thought which are denoted by the terms <i>time</i> and <i>space</i>,
and ask what are they? Are they existences or attributes,
are they ideal or real, are they entities or relations? Have
we any clear and definite notions of which these are the
unequivocal signs? The solution of these questions is the
essential condition of a true philosophy of time and space.</p>

<p>First of all, is it not self-evident that, if time and space
are for us the objects of thought, they must be conceived
under the categories of <i>Being</i> or <i>Quality</i> or <i>Relation</i>?
If they can not be thought as real existences, or as attri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>butes
of existing things, or as relations among existing
things, they can not be thought at all&mdash;they are non-entities,
and we can not think about nothing. "Thought
can only be realized by thinking <i>something</i> ... this something
must be thought as existing ... and we can only
think a thing as existing, by thinking it as existing in this
or that determinate manner of existence; and whenever
we cease to think of something as existing&mdash;something
existing in a determinate manner of existence&mdash;we cease
to think at all."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>McCosh asserts that time and space are "neither substances,
modes, nor relations."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> What, then, are they?
He answers, "They seem to be entitled to be put in a
class by themselves, and resemble substances, modes, relations
only in that they are <i>existences, entities, realities</i>."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
But if they are entitled to be put in a class by
themselves, what is the name of that class, and by what
characteristic marks shall we distinguish it? If they are
realities, they must have being, or inhere in something
that has being, or be relations of something in being. If
they are existences, they must be the objects of <i>sense
perception</i>, or <i>rational intuition</i>, or <i>immediate judgment</i>,
otherwise they can not be cognized at all, for "the
mind can not create objects of its own cognition."</p>

<p>We ask again, What <i>are</i> space and time? McCosh
and Dr. Porter both answer: 1. They are not substances.
This no one will dispute. They are not material
substances having sensible qualities which can be the objects
of sense perception. Space and time are not perceived
by the senses.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Neither are they spiritual sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>stances.
We do not know them as having power and
performing acts. 2. They both reply, They are not attributes
or qualities of matter or spirit. This, also, no one
will dispute, if the word "time" is not used as a synonym
for "eternity," and the word "space" is not used as a
synonym for "immensity," because "eternity" and "immensity"
are attributes of the absolute Spirit. 3. They
both assert, They are not relations. This is disputed by
many: by Leibnitz, by Hamilton, by Saisset, by Calderwood,
and by others. Leibnitz says, "Space is the order
of things co-existing. Time is the order of things successive."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Hamilton says, "Space, like time, is only the intuition
or the conception of a certain correlation of existence."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Calderwood defines time "as a certain correlation
of existence," and "space as the recognized relation
of extended objects."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> And Saisset regards time and
space as standing in the same category with mathematical
relations.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> These are, to say the least, distinguished
names in philosophy. The opinions of men who have
for years pondered these profound problems are at any
rate entitled to proper consideration, and if in opposition
to their views it is affirmed that time and space as understanding-concepts
are <i>not</i> relations, some reasons should
be assigned. All the proof offered by Dr. McCosh is that
"we know no two or more things which by their relation
could yield space and time" (p. 211). We answer,
promptly, <i>duration</i> and <i>change</i> do yield the relation of
time. "The consciousness of succession in our mental
states is in reality our consciousness of time."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>-existence
of two or more extended objects must yield the
relation of space, for "empty space is nothing more than
the relative distance of extended objects from each other,
measured on a standard similar to that which applies to
the bodies themselves. In this way it is equally accurate
to say that there is a certain specified <i>distance</i> between
the bodies, and that there is <i>nothing</i> between them, because
space is nothing but their relation to each other."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Annihilate all finite existences, and what remains? Nothing
but the immensity of God. Let one atom of matter
be created, and we have extension. Let a second atom be
created, and there is now a relation of distance, position,
direction&mdash;that is, there is <i>space</i>.</p>

<p>The only remark made by Dr. Porter which has a direct
bearing on this important discussion is that "Space
and time are neither relations nor correlations, but <i>correlates</i>
to beings and events" ("The Human Intellect,"
p. 568). It may seem an act of presumption in one
who has spent much less time on these studies than Dr.
Porter to offer a criticism on this final deliverance. But
when he tells us that space and time are neither relations
nor correlations, after having through four pages "On the
relations of space and time concepts to motion" labored
to sustain the doctrine of Trendelenberg that "the categories
of space and time are derived from the universal
and all-pervading motion which is common to both" (p.
526), we confess we are amazed. Let it be granted that
the spatial and temporal relations can be, in their last
analysis, resolved into motion, still the question remains,
How can we conceive of motion except as the result of
force?&mdash;that is, of power actually exerted somewhere. In
the last analysis, therefore, the relations of space, time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and motion are resolved into "<i>the relation of causality</i>."
The conclusion seems inevitable that time and space are
<i>correlations of finite existences</i>. Annihilate all finite existences
and finite duration, and there is neither space nor
time&mdash;that is, there is "pure nothing." Or, more properly,
there is the Omnipotence, the Immensity, the Eternity of
God, whose causation may give existence to finite beings
with all their necessary as well as contingent relations.
"Whoever maintains a beginning of the world must also
adopt <i>a beginning of time</i>, for only worldly being, which
according to its notion has not its ground in itself, but is
an originated being, can at all have time for the form of
its existence."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>And now, in summing up, let us see if we can clearly
disengage three classes of distinct notions:</p>

<p>1. The notion of concrete and finite <span class="smcap">EXTENSION</span> as the
essential quality of matter; and the notion of finite <span class="smcap">DURATION</span>
as a quality of changeful dependent existence.</p>

<p>2. The notion of <span class="smcap">SPACE</span> as the relation of co-existing
material things&mdash;that is, the relation of position, distance,
direction, hereness, thereness; and the notion of time as
the relation of successive existence&mdash;that is, the relation
of priority and posteriority, of past, present, and future.</p>

<p>3. The notion of <span class="smcap">IMMENSITY</span> and <span class="smcap">ETERNITY</span>&mdash;that is, an
absolute continuity and illimitability of being, the absence
of all limit, all quantity, all beginning and end, the attributes
of the unconditioned Being. Let us endeavor
sharply to define these notions, which unhappily are too
often confounded.</p>

<p>1. The external senses in their different degrees, especially
sight and touch, give us the knowledge of objects
that are <i>extended</i> and figured. The body I grasp with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the hand or survey with the eye has limits, outlines,
angles, surfaces&mdash;that is, it has more or less <span class="smcap">EXTENSION</span>.
The inner sense gives us the knowledge of the
changes and successions of our mental life. But, amid
all these changes, I am conscious there is a something
which <i>endures</i>. What is that permanent something
which I apprehend under all the varying mental states?
It is that principle of personal identity which I call <i>I</i>&mdash;<i>myself</i>.
To feel and know that I am the same person
under all modifications of my mental activity is to <i>endure</i>.
Through the aid of memory, which enables me to
recall past mental states, and the immediate consciousness
of personal existence, through all these changes I obtain
the notion of <span class="smcap">DURATION</span>. The notions of Extension and
Duration are clear to my mind.</p>

<p>2. Besides the notion of extended bodies, I have also
the notion of position, distance, direction among extended
bodies. They exist in various relations to each other;
they are here or there, above or below, near at hand or indefinitely
remote. It may be the distance between two
particles of dust in the sunbeam, or the walls of the room,
or between the earth and the sun, or between the sun and
the outermost planet of our system, or between the earth
and the remotest star which twinkles at the outposts of
the universe. Position, distance, direction are all <i>relations</i>.
And to all these relations I prefer, with Sir John
Herschel, to give the generic name <span class="smcap">SPACE</span>.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Then I have
no confusion of thought, and no difficulty or contradiction
in using the language of Cousin, Hamilton, and McCosh,
when they speak of "determinate and limited space,"
"particular spaces," "parts of space," and "proportions
of space."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>Along with the notion of duration (and succession of
different states in the same existence), I am conscious that
this duration is capable of admeasurement by common
standards, and ideally divided into periods of longer or
shorter duration. This duration may be measured by
successive states of consciousness, or facts of domestic history,
or, better still, by the succession of day and night,
or the relative position of the sun in the heavens, the revolutions
of the moon around the earth, or of the earth
around the sun. These are really world-measurements
of duration. Since, then, duration can be measured from
any point and in any proportions, it is clear that measurement
is a purely relative thing&mdash;a relation. Of any such
thing as "pure time" or "absolute time" we have no
knowledge. <span class="smcap">Time</span> <i>is the measure of finite duration</i>&mdash;the
correlation of things successive. And if I confine myself
to this usage, I am under no necessity of using the paradoxical
language of many philosophers, "time is eternity!"</p>

<p>3. We come, lastly, to the notions or ideas of <span class="smcap">IMMENSITY</span>
and <span class="smcap">ETERNITY</span>, and we ask, Are these necessary ideas of
the reason, or can they be confounded with the relations
of co-existence and succession on the one hand, or with
the attributes of finite extension and duration on the
other?</p>

<p>This is not a mere question of systems of philosophy
or theology&mdash;it is a question of facts. Are the ideas of
Absolute Infinity and Eternity necessary intuitions of the
reason? The world of sense-perception, the world of science,
is phenomenal and contingent. All that is offered
to our observation is <i>limited</i> and <i>temporal</i>. The universe
surrendered to our science is one of quantities and
quantitative relations. It is conditioned by number and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
form. Its extensions, spaces, and motions are capable of
admeasurement. Its worlds and systems are subject to
numeration. The phenomena of the universe are all subject
to change, they have beginning, succession, and end.
But beyond the notions of the limited and the temporal,
we find in consciousness the ideas of the <i>illimitable</i> and
the <i>eternal</i>; the latter always appearing to reason as the
necessary correlates of the former. The finite necessarily
supposes the infinite; the temporal necessarily supposes
the eternal. The two classes of notions are essentially
different, and defy all attempts to generalize them under
higher concepts. The infinite is not the totality of finite
existences; eternity is not the prolongation of finite durations.
Immensity and eternity are absolutely and unconditionally
necessary ideas. I can easily conceive the non-existence
of any finite thing. I can, without any contradiction,
suppose the whole world to be destroyed. All
which has a derived and a dependent existence may cease
to be. But we can not conceive the source of all existence
annihilated. There is one notion which it is impossible
for me to annihilate in thought, and that is the
notion of absolute being&mdash;underived, unconditioned,
changeless, eternal being. Despite the destruction of all
determinate extension and all finite duration, there remains
a Supreme Reality, unlimited, unbeginning, and
endless, as an absolute necessity of thought.</p>

<p>Here, then, are two absolute ideas found in the depths
of consciousness&mdash;the ideas of <span class="smcap">IMMENSITY</span> and <span class="smcap">ETERNITY</span>;
ideas as real, as natural, and as necessary as the notions of
extension and duration. Immensity and Eternity are attributes
of God. Extension and Duration are attributes
of finite, dependent existence. Space and time are relations
between co-existing things and successive events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>If by this somewhat abstruse and, perhaps, too lengthy
discussion we have succeeded in proving that Time and
Space are simply relations between co-existent things and
successive events, which, apart from things and events,
have no reality, and are "nothing but the bare possibility
of body and change," then we have disentangled the
Christian doctrine of absolute creation from the embarrassment
occasioned by supposing "the coeval and co-eternal
existence of Time and Space as the <i>necessary</i> conditions
of the Divine activity." If Time and Space are relations
between things and events, then God, as the almighty
cause of things and relations, is the efficient cause
of space and time, and the creative act was not conditioned
by them.</p>

<p>The affirmation of the necessary existence of Space,
Time, and Number as co-eternal with and independent of
God,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> prepared the way for and rendered plausible the
further affirmation of "the coeval existence of matter as
the condition and medium of the Divine agency and manifestation."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
For if Space, Time, and Number are eternal,
<i>why may not Matter be eternal</i>? But why stop with the
assertion of the eternity of Space, Time, Number, and
Matter? "If we admit that there may be something uncaused,
there is no reason to assume a cause of anything."
If we admit the eternity of Matter, how can we deny the
eternity of Force? We can not conceive of the existence
of substance without some properties or qualities, and of
all the properties of matter, gravitation or weight seems
to approach nearest to an essential, necessary quality.
And if we concede the eternity of matter and gravitating
force, why not admit the eternity of law&mdash;that is, "uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>formity
of properties and relations;" uniformity in the
results arising from the motions and changes of matter?
And when so much is granted, why not grant that a consequent
<i>Order</i> of the universe must also be eternal? why
not grant that the universe is an infinite succession of orderly
phenomena without a beginning and end? After
the first concession that matter is uncreated and eternal,
how can any one refute the doctrine of Hume that the
universe never had a beginning, and that under some one
or another possible phase&mdash;amid the infinite possibility of
phases&mdash;it is both eternal and infinite? How, after this
admission, can we deny that the universe is "a series of
events existing eternally in a state of order without a
cause other than the eternally inherent laws of matter?"</p>

<p>It would be easy to show that all those writers on
"Natural Theology" who have made the least concession
in regard to this fundamental question have involved
themselves in entanglements and difficulties from which
they could not logically extricate themselves.</p>

<p>Dr. Chalmers contends that the mere existence of matter
with its properties and laws would not involve the affirmation
of an Absolute First Cause. The proof, he says,
lies solely in the disposition, collocation, and arrangement
of these properties and laws in their relation to each other,
so as to secure harmonious and beneficial results. So far
as the argument for the existence of God is concerned, he
provisionally concedes that <i>matter, with all its laws, may
be eternal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> True, he says that he grants the eternity of
matter simply for the purposes of his argument. But
what right has he to grant it for the purposes of his argument,
and then to deny it in obedience to the decisive affirmation
of a "well-accredited revelation?" If Divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
revelation teaches the non-eternity of matter, this is for the
Christian a truth&mdash;a fundamental truth; and whoever surrenders
or compromises a fundamental position must finally
fail in his management of the Theistic argument. The
intuitions of reason and the doctrines of revelation are
but separate rays from the one eternal fountain of light;
and if we ignore or compromise the fundamental truths
of revelation, reason will refuse to place her <i>imprimatur</i>
upon and give her indorsement to our lame and halting
proofs. This is strikingly illustrated by Chalmers's failure
to "construct an argument for a God" that satisfies the
reason, after he has affirmed "the eternity of matter for the
purpose of bringing out his conclusion" (p. 79). But Dr.
Chalmers can not stop with the simple concession that
matter is eternal. Only grant its necessary existence, and
"it is impossible to imagine that along with existence it
should not have <i>properties</i> ... and <i>laws</i>" (p. 75). Now,
if the admission that a finite, composite, divisible substance
may be self-existent, and have eternal properties
and laws, is not logically inconsistent, how can he show
that these properties and laws in their eternal action and
reaction are not adequate to the production of a series of
phenomena which to our understanding may appear harmonious?
Can eternal laws produce any thing but order?
The existing order of things is the only possible order that
could arise from the <i>necessary</i> operation of eternal laws,
and there can be no choice, design, or purpose in the universe.
Collocation, arrangement, adaptation, are only subjective
anthropomorphic conceptions we impose upon nature.
If matter and its laws are eternal, how will Chalmers
extricate himself from this dilemma? By this admission
he places a weapon in the hands of the anti-Theist, by which
the latter may cut the teleological argument to pieces.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>My esteemed friend, Dr. Mahan, in his zeal to overthrow
the ontological proof of the being of God, and to
vindicate for the etiological proof the sole claim to validity,
has been betrayed into a similar inconsistency. That
there is any <i>à priori</i> proof of the being of God is in his
estimation a "wild chimera." "<i>Formation</i> from pre-existing
materials" constitutes "the exclusive basis" of Natural
Theology.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Matter, then, <i>may</i> be eternal, and an infinite
series of events existing in a state of order is conceivable
and possible. At page 85 of his "Natural Theology"
he writes: "Mr. Hume has undeniably announced
the truth <i>as it is</i> upon this subject, to wit, that the idea of
a nature eternally existing in a state of order without a
cause other than the eternally inhering laws of nature, is
no more self-contradictory than the idea of an eternally
existing and infinite mind who originated this order&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
mind existing without a cause." After several pages disfigured
by a labored effort to prove the possibility and
logical consistency of an "infinite series of events existing
in an orderly succession," he sums up with the imperious
assertion that "the argument against the possibility of an
infinite series of events stands revealed as a <i>logical absurdity</i>"
(p. 88).</p>

<p>It is our deliberate conclusion, however, that the "logical
absurdity" lies in the position of Dr. Mahan. "The idea
of order in the Finite without a cause is no more self-contradictory
than the idea of order in the Infinite without
a cause." Mark the two points which stand out clearly
in this strange assertion. First, the Finite here is nature&mdash;that
is, matter and its laws. Secondly, the Infinite is the
Supreme Mind. Dr. Mahan asserts that this <i>finite</i> may
be conceived as <i>eternally</i> existing&mdash;that is, as existing
through <i>infinite</i> time; in other words, <i>the finite may be
infinite</i>. For a thing or being, or for a series of things or
beings, to be at once "finite" and "infinite" Dr. Mahan
says "is not self-contradictory." This is on a par with
the logic of Hegel&mdash;"Contradictory opposites are identical."
Again, we ask, Is there no difference between
"finite matter" and "Infinite Mind?" Is not matter
composite, extended, divisible, and limited? Is not Infinite
Mind unextended, incomposite, indivisible, and illimitable?
The mere existence of matter does not necessarily
involve the idea of <i>Order</i>. There are nebulæ existing
in the universe "utterly devoid of all symmetry of
form, ... irregular and capricious in their shapes and convolutions
to a most extraordinary degree."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Wherever
order is presented, we instinctively and infallibly ascribe
it to mind. Mind for all of us, and forever, is the anal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ogon
and exponent of Order in every sphere, irrespective
of all knowledge on our part as to when or how it had a
beginning.</p>

<p>Furthermore, on the main issue we affirm briefly&mdash;if
matter is extended, it is measurable; if it is measurable,
it must have definite limits; if it has definite limits, it
can not be infinite. Now that which is finite, limited,
quantitive, conditioned, can not be self-existent, can not
be infinite. Infinitude is illimitation by kind, quantity,
or degree&mdash;illimitation by temporal, spatial, or numerical
relations. An "infinite series" is therefore a contradiction
<i>in adjecto</i>. "As every number, although immeasurably
and inconceivably great, is impossible without <i>unity</i> as its
basis, so every series, being itself a number, is impossible
unless a <i>first term</i> is given as its commencement.... Even
if it should be allowed that the series has no <i>first term</i>,
but has originated <i>ab æterno</i>, it must always at each instant
have a <i>last term</i>; the series as a whole can not be
infinite."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> If one thing more can be added to the number
of existing things in the universe, then it is not infinite
in number or in extent. In short, a series implies
a succession of terms, or members, or links; if there is a
last term, there must be a first term; if there is a last
link, there must be a first. Through an Unconditioned
First Cause, originating and conditioning all the members
thereof, is a series conceivable or possible. To apply
to number or quantity the designation of infinitude is
surely <i>the</i> "absurdity" in presence of which all others
pale. We grant that the term "infinite series" is employed
by mathematicians in a loose manner, to denote
that which exceeds our powers of mensuration or conception,
but which nevertheless has bounds or limits&mdash;the <i>in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>definite</i>,
but not the infinite;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> such loose use of terms in
philosophy, however, is inadmissible. The final reply of
Dr. Mahan, "that the series under consideration is one
which by hypothesis has no first," is the extreme of absurdity.
It is as though a man should talk of a "round
square" or a "bilinear figure," and when remonstrated
with as to the contradictory character of these phrases,
should reply, "Yes, but the 'square' under consideration
is one which by hypothesis is 'round,' and the 'figure'
is one which by hypothesis is formed by 'two lines!'"
Men may make all kinds of strange hypotheses, but the
strangest of all is that of an infinite-finite.</p>

<p>These incautious writers of "Natural Theology" all assert,
as a fundamental doctrine, that God is the Absolute
and Unconditioned Cause. We might ask, Whence do
they derive this fundamental truth that God is "absolute
and unconditioned," if not by an <i>à priori</i> rational intuition?
We let that pass, however, to press the more pertinent
question&mdash;How can God be "the absolute cause,"
if matter is coeval with and independent of Him? And
how can He be the "unconditioned cause," if space, time,
number, and matter necessarily exist as the <i>conditions</i> of
the Divine agency and manifestation? If matter, with
its essential properties and laws, exist independent of the
Deity, do not these impose conditions upon the action of
the Deity, and determine it to certain necessary modes?
If so, God can not be the unconditioned Cause. Instead
of one supreme, sole First Principle, there are at least two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
principles, God and Necessity, and may be more. No
system of Natural Theology can maintain its integrity
and consistency except by holding fast to the fundamental
postulate&mdash;God is the Absolute and Unconditioned
Cause of all things, of matter and form, quality
and relation, purpose and law.</p>

<p>And now, in conclusion, we may properly ask, Whence
arises the necessity for assuming the coeval and co-eternal
existence of matter besides and independent of God?
Why should the theologian feel himself under the necessity
of prejudicing the Biblical conception of Creation by
any such concession? The only reasons we have seen assigned
are, first, that "creation out of nothing is discredited
by the discoveries of modern science;"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> secondly, that
"an absolute origination is inconceivable and self-destructive."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
In attempting an estimate of the weight of these
reasons, we would first suggest that the question of <i>absolute</i>
creation has been prejudiced by the persistent employment
of the old formula of "creation out of nothing,"
as though "nothing" contained the cause of existence,
and the universe was developed out of nothing.
The Christian Fathers, who first employed the phrase κτίσις ἐκ τοῦ μὴ
ὄντος, never indulged in such representations.
The idea they sought to express was that the production of
"<i>otherness</i>," the awarding of existence to something besides
Himself, was an absolutely free act of God which was not
conditioned by any thing external to Himself&mdash;in a word,
that God is the positive original ground of all existence.</p>

<p>But who shall decide that this doctrine has been discredited
by the progress of science? What special discovery
of modern science has so revealed to us the ul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>timate
constitution of matter, that we can affirm its absolute
reality and its eternal existence? Nay, are the
most advanced physicists and physiologists agreed as to
whether, apart from our subjective, ideal conceptions,
matter has any reality? If we are not utterly mistaken,
the entire tendency of science is to reduce matter from
the rank of entities to the rank of phenomena. "The
old speculations of Philosophy, which cut the ground from
Materialism by showing how little we know of matter, are
now being daily reinforced by the subtle analysis of the
physiologist, the chemist, and the electrician. Under
that analysis matter dissolves and disappears, <i>surviving
only as the phenomena of Force</i>."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> We offer no opinion
as to the validity of this new doctrine, but are sure it is
the doctrine of modern science as represented by Faraday,
Owen, McVicar, Bayma, Exley, Wallace, Poisson,
Poyntong, Laycock, and, we think, Huxley. If modern
science has resolved all our external sensations, even the
feeling of resistance, into "phenomena of Force," then, according
to the doctrine of Mr. Martineau, it had a beginning&mdash;"<i>phenomena
demand causation</i>.... Supreme Entity
needs no cause." "The universe resolves itself into
a perpetual genesis," and "the Theist is perfectly justified
in treating it as disqualified for self-existence."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton contends that "an absolute commencement"
is inconceivable. All the conception we can
possibly form of Creation is "merely as the evolution of
new forms of existence by the fiat of the Deity." "Let
us suppose the very crisis of creation. Can we realize it
to ourselves in thought, that the moment after the universe
came into manifested being there was a larger complement
of existence in the universe and its Author to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>gether
than there was the moment before in the Deity
himself alone? This we can not imagine."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>There are, we presume, very few Hamiltonians who are
prepared to indorse this bold statement of their master.
Mansel, the editor and annotator of his "Lectures," has
very distinctly and emphatically expressed his dissent.
"Whether it be true or not that we can not conceive the
quantity of existence to be increased or diminished, there
is at any rate no such inability as regards the <i>quantity of
matter</i>. It may be true as a fact that no material atom
has been added to the world since the Creation; but the
assertion, however true, is certainly not necessary. The
power which created once must be conceived as able to
create again, whether that ability is actually exercised or
not. The same conclusion is still more evident when
we proceed from the consideration of matter to that of
mind. Of matter, we maintain that the creation of new
portions is <i>perfectly conceivable</i>&mdash;as a result, at least, if not
as a process; of mind, we believe that such creation actually
takes place. Every man who comes into the world
comes into it as a distinct individual, having a personality
and consciousness of his own, and that personality is a distinct
accession to the number of persons previously existing....
Every new person that comes into the world is a
<i>new existence</i>."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Hence we are not justified in asserting
that all actual existences are only different modes of one
identical reality. We can not merely conceive, but we
<i>know</i>, as a primary fact of consciousness, that the <i>sum</i> of
existence, of personal conscious being, which is the most
fundamental reality, may be increased in the universe.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>We readily confess that the act of creation&mdash;that is,
<i>causing wholly new existence</i>&mdash;is utterly incomprehensible
to us; so are thousands of other things. I am told by
the physicist that eight hundred billions of ether-impulses
impinge on the retina of the eye in a second of time to
produce the sensation of deep violet;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and I believe it, but
at the same time it is to me incomprehensible. My reason
affirms that the First Cause must be infinite; and I believe
it, but I can not comprehend Infinity. No logician of the
present day teaches that comprehensibility is a test of
truth. Is our finite capacity of conceiving or of doing a
standard for Omnipotence? The only question here involved
is, Can Infinite Power produce that mode of being
we call matter? Does such an exercise of Infinite Power
involve a contradiction? I conscientiously submit this
question to my own reason, and I confess I am unable
to see any contradiction. To my experiential knowledge
matter presents "the essential characteristics at once of
a <i>manufactured article</i> and a <i>subordinate agent</i>."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
"This," says the distinguished Prof. Maxwell, "precludes
the idea of its being eternal and self-existent.... It
must have been <i>created</i>."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The notion of its origination
by a Power which is unconditioned and every way
unlimited, satisfies my reason, and affords the best solution
of the problem of its existence. That it is self-existent,
independent, eternal&mdash;"a second other God"&mdash;is directly
contradictory. The original, primitive fountain of
existence is <i>Mind</i>. This must stand at the fountain-head.
God is the sole and absolute Cause of all things&mdash;of time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and all temporal relations; of space, and all spatial relations;
of the primordial element, and all its properties.
<i>The creative act was not conditioned by Time or Space
or Matter.</i><a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

CREATION.&mdash;THE GENESIS OR BEGINNING.</h2>

<p>"The laws of nature can not account for their own origin."&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. S. Mill.</span></p>


<p>Creation was the absolutely free act of God, unconditioned
by any pre-existing thing. Matter with its properties
and forms, its temporal, spatial, and numerical relations;
Spirit with its life and feeling, its ideas and laws&mdash;these
had all their origin in the creative Word of God.
Whatever is, and is not God, is the creature of God. This
is the Biblical conception of Creation.</p>

<p>Origination and formation are so immediately and inseparably
united in the Biblical notion of Creation that the
revelation of the one is the revelation of the other, and we
can not deny the former without logically involving ourselves
in the denial of the latter. He who gave to matter
its forms must have given it its essential properties, upon
which many of its forms depend; and He who gave to
matter its essential properties must have given it <i>origination</i>,
for how can we conceive of substance devoid of all
attributes? Whether, therefore, the account in Genesis
"be found to have in view, mainly or solely, a universal or
a partial creation; whether the <i>principium</i> there mentioned
be the particular beginning of the special work there
described, or the <i>principium principiorum</i>,&mdash;the beginning
of all beginnings&mdash;the Bible is in either case a protest
against the dogma of the eternity of the world, or of
the eternity of matter."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>This notion of Creation as a pure supernatural origination
is the only one which reason can accept as adequate,
satisfactory, and complete. Formation without origination
is a conception of creation which is logically incomplete.
It fails to meet the demand of reason for an Absolute First
Principle adequate to the production and explanation of
all existence. There are outlying elements of the problem
which it can not grasp in the unity of a Fundamental Idea.
Matter with its properties, Number, Time, and Space, with
their relations, are still lying outside of its field, and setting
themselves up as self-existent and independent realities,
which by their apparent or conceded independence
must necessarily impose <i>conditions</i> upon the Divine activity,
and perpetually embarrass the human mind in its effort
to think of God as the free and unconditioned Cause.
Reason demands that absolute unity shall stand at the
fountain-head of being, and every system of philosophy
which allows of more than one self-existent and independent
and underived reality bewilders and staggers the
understanding, and vitiates all its processes of thought.
After this concession every argument for the being of
God seems to us a <i>petitio principii</i>.</p>

<p>Reason and Revelation, then, are agreed in the affirmation
that the Universe, both as to its matter and form, had
its origin in the creative Word and Will of God. How far
this affirmation is sustained by the <i>à posteriori</i> inductions
of physical science is a question of the deepest interest,
and to this we now invite attention.</p>

<p>This question naturally divides itself into two subordinate
inquiries, one relating to the <i>form</i>, the other to the
<i>matter</i> of the universe, which may be thus presented:</p>

<p>1. Had the existing <i>Order</i> of the universe a beginning?
Had the forms, relations, laws, and harmonies of the universe
a beginning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Had that which is the ground of all forms, the subject
of all changes and relations, a beginning? Had the <i>Matter</i>
of the universe a beginning?</p>

<p>In regard to the first question, we remark in general:
<i>The common conviction of our race in all ages has been
that the existing order of the universe had a beginning,
and will have an end.</i></p>

<p>It has been affirmed by some mental philosophers that
mankind has an intuitive and natural belief in the uniformity
of nature, and the consequent stability and permanence
of the universe. Reid, the father of the Scottish school of
philosophy, says, "God has implanted in the human mind
an original principle by which he believes in and expects
the continuance of the course of nature." It is a matter
of surprise that so acute a thinker should have fallen into
so flagrant an error. He has evidently confounded our
natural belief in causation with our acquired experiences
of uniformity. That "like causes will always produce like
effects" is a native intuition; but that "the same causes will
always continue in operation, and always operate with the
same intensity," is a mere presumption. Our faith in the
uniformity and permanent stability of nature is an induction
from experience, and not a natural and necessary intuition
of the mind.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Far from entertaining a belief in the permanence and
stability of the present order of nature, the great mass of
mankind in earlier times regarded the system of things as
liable to constant interference on the part of supernatural
powers. In all ages of the world the existing order of nature
has been regarded as temporal, and the flow of terrestrial
and even of cosmical events has been conceived as
liable to be broken up by universal revolutions. The his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>torical
evidence of this universal belief in "geological catastrophes"
has been fully brought forward by Dr. Winchell
in his "Sketches of Creation."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Traditions of a primal
chaos and of periodic cataclysms are found among the
Greeks, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Chaldæans, Hebrews, Persians,
Arabians, Hindoos, South Sea Islanders, and the Aztecs.
And among those nations in which the physical sciences
have been cultivated the same conceptions are still
entertained. As science has extended our acquaintance
with natural phenomena in all parts of the earth, and beyond
the earth into the celestial spaces, men have gradually
attained a belief in the uniformity of nature. But the doctrine
of periodical catastrophes has not been abandoned by
scientific men. When men now speak of the uniformity
of nature, they use that term in a very large sense, and
even loose sense, as including catastrophes and convulsions
of an intense and extensive kind;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and, as we shall presently
see, the most advanced and exact modern science
teaches us to contemplate a grand final catastrophe in
which all life will be extinguished on the earth, and the
globe itself shall be "ensepulchred in an extinguished
sun." The attempt, therefore, to represent the belief in the
uniformity of nature as a universal and necessary truth is
vain. We have no <i>à priori</i> ground for believing in the
permanence of the universe.</p>

<p>The common conviction of our race that the universe
had a beginning, that it has been the subject of great catastrophal
changes, and that it will finally come to an end,
is not to be regarded as an insignificant fact. As Herbert
Spencer justly remarks, "We must presume that beliefs
that have long existed and have been widely diffused ... be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>liefs
that are perennial and universal ... have some foundation,
and some amount of verity."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Universal beliefs must
rest on some common ground. That common ground can
not be experience. A belief which was as clearly and confidently
held four thousand years ago as it is held to-day
can not have been gradually attained by successive generalizations.
It is grounded on the fundamental antithesis
between Becoming and Being, phenomena and reality, the
changeful and the permanent, the finite and the infinite,
the temporal and the eternal, which has been a necessary
form of thought to all minds in all ages. The human mind
has never been able to conceive these contradictory opposites
as predicable of the same subject. The universe as
presented to sense is a perpetual genesis, a ceaseless change;
therefore it can not be permanent. It is a time-march of
phenomena; therefore it can not be eternal. It is limited
by quantity and quantitative relations; therefore it can not
be infinite. Thus reason has always conceived the universe
as having a <i>beginning</i>, and has confidently predicted that
it will come to an <i>end</i>. All systems of philosophy, and,
indeed, many systems of religion, have been attempts to
explain "the beginning or origin of things"&mdash;that is, they
have been "<i>à priori</i> theories of the universe."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Even
Atheism itself comes under this definition: it is an attempt
to explain the origin of the universe and of man
on the <i>à priori</i> assumption of the self-existence of Matter,
Space, and Motion. Thus all systems of thought, ancient
and modern, have had their birth in the innate conviction
that there is something to be explained, and that
human reason is adequate to the task of furnishing an explanation.
They all assume that the universe had a be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ginning,
and their one, central problem is, "How are we
to conceive aright the origin of things?"</p>

<p>In what does this differ from the problem of modern
science? It is true that Comte would limit positive science
to "the study of phenomena in their orders of co-existence,
resemblance, and succession," an idea which the
word "positive" by no means conveys. And Tyndall asserts
that "the man of science, if he confine himself within
his own limits, will give no answer to the question" as
to the origin of things. At the same time he admits that
"he can clearly show that the present state of things <i>may</i>
be derivative."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The great masters of science, however,
refuse to acknowledge any such arbitrary limitations.
"The essence of science," says Sir William Thomson,
"consists in inferring antecedent conditions, and anticipating
future evolutions from phenomena which have actually
come under observation."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> If this be the <i>essence</i> of
science, then we presume that it is competent to throw
some light on the primitive condition of the universe, and
give some prevision of its future destiny. Did not Comte
himself teach that the solar system was once all nebula,
and that it will yet collapse into an exhausted and extinguished
sun?<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Is it true, then, that physical science by its
inductive inference of "antecedent conditions," does really
furnish a solid confirmation of the <i>à priori</i> and native
conviction of our race that the universe had a beginning?
Then most assuredly even physical science is carrying us
forward toward the ultimate unity of all truth&mdash;a unity
which can be realized perfectly only by the constant mut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>ual
determination of <i>à priori</i> and empirical knowledge,
a synthesis and equipoise of physical and metaphysical
truths.</p>

<p>This is the most obvious tendency of modern science in
its relation to the question under consideration. Nothing
is more remarkable in the present aspect of physical research
than what has been aptly called "the transcendental
character of its results." As George Henry Lewes observes,
"the fundamental ideas of modern science are as
transcendental as any of the axioms of ancient philosophy."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Palætiological science in general has advanced
by sure and steady steps, through careful observation and
experiment, inductive inference, and the application of
exact mathematical calculus to the recognition of the
truth long ago announced by Paul: "The things which
are seen are <i>temporal</i>, the things which are not seen are
<i>eternal</i>." Dynamical Geology, Astronomical Palætiology,
Cosmogony, Molecular Physics, Abstract Dynamics, have
all landed in the same inevitable conclusion that "the existing
order of things had a beginning." Sir William
Thomson's doctrine of the "Dissipation of Energy" leads
us, by sure steps of deductive reasoning, to the necessary
future of the universe&mdash;necessary, that is, if physical laws
remain unchanged&mdash;"so it enables us distinctly to say
that the present order of things has not been evolved
through infinite past time by the agency of laws now at
work, but must have had a <i>distinctive beginning</i>, a state
beyond which we are totally unable to penetrate&mdash;a state
which must have been produced by <i>other than the now
acting causes</i>."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The science of Geology reduces all terrestrial phenomena
to the great law of finite duration. If there be one
scientific induction which may be fairly pronounced legitimate
and irrefragable, it is this one&mdash;that the existing
terrestrial economy had a beginning. "All organic existence,
recent or extinct, vegetable or animal, had a beginning;
there was a time when they were not. The geologist
can indicate that time, if not by years, at least by periods,
and show what were its relations to the periods that
went before and that came after." He can carry us
back to the time when man did not exist upon the earth,
when no mammals existed; to the time when no birds, no
reptiles, no fishes existed&mdash;when even Huxley's protoplasm
had no being; "when all creation, from its centre
to its circumference, was a creation of dead inorganic matter,"<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
and when there was not one spore or monad or
atom of life throughout its dark domain. The form of
the earth itself clearly reveals its history, and points us to
that beginning. Its bulging equator and flattened poles,
its pavement of congealed lava, which in some cases we
name granite; nay, the oldest water-worn pavement composed
of the detritus of the igneous rocks&mdash;all attest the
emergence of our planet from a molten condition, and a
temperature<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> in which no life could exist; so that even
Tyndall admits "there are the strongest grounds for believing
that during a certain period of its history the earth
was not, nor was it fit to be, the theatre of life."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The earth was once a molten mass heated to incandescence&mdash;a
self-luminous globe. On this point there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
scarcely any difference of opinion among scientific men.
Furthermore, a large majority of modern scientists regard
themselves as justified in the affirmation of a still anterior
nebulous condition. If the nebular hypothesis is accepted,
then we are required to contemplate a period when the
earth did not exist, and when even the matter which now
enters into its constitution was an undistinguished part of
the nebula from which the whole solar system was evolved.</p>

<p>Many exact observations and mathematical computations
as to the secular cooling of the earth give results
which are in strict accordance with this theory of its primitive
igneous condition. The observed facts clearly indicate
that the earth is becoming, on the whole, cooler from
age to age, and that the natural current of events is carrying
it inevitably to a state of total refrigeration.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The
fossil remains now found within the arctic circle indicate
that at a period, not extremely remote, tropical vegetation
flourished, and forms of animal life subsisted there
which are now confined to the torrid zone. Mammoths
lived in the now uninhabited polar regions, and tree-ferns
and the tropical shell-fish found there a home.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The
surface of the earth was then warmed by internal heat
which since that period has waned; that heat has been
gradually dissipated in the surrounding space, as a red-hot
ball suspended even in the warm air of a room must,
according to the well-known laws of radiation and absorption,
necessarily part with its heat.</p>

<p>Many experiments carefully conducted in our time show
that the temperature of the earth increases with the depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to which we penetrate: "In boring for the artesian well
at Grenelle, which is 546 metres deep, it was observed that
the temperature augmented at the rate of 1° Centigrade
for every 30 metres. The same result was obtained by
observations in the artesian well at Mondorf, in Luxemburg;
this well is 671 metres in depth, and its waters
34° warm." As the result of many investigations in
mines and borings, Sir William Thomson concludes that
the average inference may be thus stated&mdash;there is on the
whole about 1° Fahr. of elevation of temperature per 50
British feet of descent.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> If this increase is uniform&mdash;and
we have no reason to suppose the contrary&mdash;then at the
depth of 50 miles there exists, says Helmholtz, a heat
sufficient to fuse all our minerals.</p>

<p>The fact that the temperature of the earth increases
with the depth necessarily involves a continual loss of
heat from its interior by conduction outward into and
through the upper crust, according to a well-known law
of equilibrium of temperatures. "Hence, since the upper
crust does not become hotter from year to year, there must
be a secular loss of heat from the earth."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Thus it appears
that from the surface of the earth and the ocean,
from thermal springs, and from three hundred active volcanoes,
the internal heat of the globe is incessantly radiated
into space and is practically lost.</p>

<p>Now this average loss of heat may be at least approximately
measured, and data are thereby furnished for determining
the probable <i>age</i> of the earth, or, perhaps more
correctly, its phase of life. If a man were to find a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
ball of iron suspended in a room, and if he were carefully
to observe the distribution of heat in the ball, he would
be able easily to determine whether the ball were becoming
hotter or cooler. If he found that the inside were hotter
than the outside, he would conclude that the ball was
cooling, and had therefore been hotter than when he found
it. So far common-sense would be his guide; but with
the aid of mathematics, and some knowledge of the physical
properties of iron and air, he could go much further,
and be able to calculate how hot the ball must have been
at any given moment, if it had not been interfered with.
Thus he would be able to say, the ball must have been
hung up less than, say, five hours ago, for at that time the
heat of the metal would have been such that it would
have been in a state of fusion, and hence not capable of
hanging as a solid mass. Precisely analogous reasoning
holds with regard to the earth: it is such a ball; it is
hotter inside than outside. The distribution of the heat
near its surface is approximately known&mdash;1° Fahr. of elevation
in temperature for 50 British feet of descent.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The
properties of the matter of which it is composed are approximately
known. The temperature at which granite
rocks are fusible has been found to be about 7000° Fahr.
This must therefore have been the temperature of the
earth in its primitive igneous condition. From these data,
Sir William Thomson has, by rigid mathematical calculations,
reached the conclusion that the consolidation of the
earth's crust commenced 98,000,000 years ago.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The rates
of increase of temperature <i>inward</i> in a great amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
average rock at various periods after the commencement
of cooling, from the primitive heat of 7000° Fahr., are estimated
by Sir William Thomson as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"At      10,000    y'rs after commencement of cooling we should have   2° per ft.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40,000&nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1°&nbsp; &nbsp; "</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At&nbsp; &nbsp;  160,000&nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1/2°&nbsp; &nbsp; "</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At&nbsp;  4,000,000&nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1/10°&nbsp; &nbsp; "</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At 100,000,000&nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1/50°&nbsp; &nbsp; "</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is therefore probable that for the last 96,000,000
years the rate of increase of temperature under ground
has gradually diminished from 1/10 to about 1/50 of a degree
Fahrenheit per foot, and that the thickness of the
crust through which any stated degree of cooling has
been experienced has gradually increased during that
period from 1/5 of its present thickness to what it now
really is."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>We freely admit our inability to sit in judgment on
the validity of Sir William Thomson's conclusions. There
are eminent geologists who entertain the opinion that
the secular cooling of the earth has proceeded with
much greater rapidity. It is, however, sufficient for our
purpose that the most distinguished physicists of the day
are agreed in teaching that <i>the existing terrestrial economy
had a beginning</i>.</p>

<p>There are other terrestrial changes which engage the attention
of the geologist, and which force upon him the conclusion
that the existing terrestrial order had a beginning
and must have an end. The surface of the earth has at intervals
undergone great changes in the disposition of its
land and water. That which is now dry land was once the
ocean-bed, and the ocean waves now roll and murmur over
what was once dry land. Sudden, or comparatively sudden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
catastrophes have extinguished the then existing creations,
and the earth has been repeopled by new orders of life.
Changes are now in progress which are gradually reducing
the populous regions of the earth to the condition of
the Sahara of Africa and the Desert of Arabia. Upper
and Lower Mesopotamia, the seat of the ancient monarchies
of Chaldæa, Assyria, and Babylonia, now present
"vast tracts of arid plain&mdash;yellow, parched, and sapless&mdash;which
have now become a bare and uninhabited desert."
That ancient continent drained by the Colorado, once as
fertile as the Valley of the Mississippi, is now the Great
American Desert. "Every freshet burdens the streams
with a load of sediment; and the Mississippi bears daily
to the Gulf material sufficient for a cotton plantation.
From the slopes of the Alleghanies and the Rocky Mountains,
from the broad acres over which the Mississippi and
the Ohio reach their silver fingers to filch from the land,
the sediments are stolen and carried away to the sea. The
Western States are slowly traveling toward the Gulf. The
hills are melting, and even the mountain cliffs are lowering
under the ceaseless conflict with storm and frost. The
summits of the Alleghanies have come down 3000 feet
from their original altitudes. Give time enough, and the
inequalities of the land will disappear. The ocean will
be filled, and again assert a triumph over the continents
which in the beginning were wrested from his dominion."
Thus by the storms of heaven, the erosion of the atmosphere,
the blasting power of frost, the gnawing of the tidal
wave, the mountains are being leveled, and the rocks and
soils carried onward by the rivers to fill up the basin of the
sea. The headlong rush of the avalanche, the murmuring
of the brook, the roaring of the sea, the voice of the
storm&mdash;all proclaim, "The things which are seen are tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>poral!"&mdash;"The
existing order of things had a beginning
and must come to an end!"<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Astronomical Palætiology reduces all celestial phenomena
to the same great law of finite duration. It teaches that
planets, stars, systems, have their birth, their process of
formation, their maturity, and their slow, protracted decay.
The ephemeron perishes in an hour, man endures his three-score
years and ten; continents and islands have their ages
and æons; the stars of heaven are not exempt from this
universal law of change and decay. According to the Nebular
Hypothesis, the formation of this our system of sun,
planets, and satellites was a process of the same kind as
that which is still going forward in the heavens. One
after another, nebulæ condense into separate masses, which
begin to revolve about each other in obedience to dynamical
laws, and form systems of which our system is a matured
example. The present aspect of this planetary system
is, however, but a passing phase in the history of its
fleeting life. Our planet was once a self-luminous orb;
it has now become opaque, and shines only with a borrowed
light. The moon is probably in a state of total
refrigeration; its lunar air and lunar seas have been
changed by intensity of cold into the solid form.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The
sun itself is radiating heat into space in quantities incomparably
greater than it receives, and, as Helmholtz affirms,
"the inexorable laws of mechanics show that its store of
heat must be finally exhausted."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The planets in their
motions encounter resistance from the interstellar ether;
they must, therefore, necessarily move in shorter and short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>er
orbits, and at last fall into the sun. Thus the Nebular
Hypothesis, combined with the doctrine of a resisting medium,
teaches us that the solar system is wending its way,
through successive changes, from a past of vaporous unity
to a future of consolidated reunion. "It was once all nebula;
it will, if left to physical agencies alone, collapse into
an extinguished and exhausted sun."</p>

<p>The astronomer who has been accustomed to regard
every question relating to his favorite science as almost
exclusively a problem in mathematics, will pronounce the
above "a crude and adventurous" attempt on the part of
the physicist to solve a problem which belongs to "the
calculus of variations." Is the universe a Conservative or
a Dissipative system? Under its present laws will it run
on forever, or will these very laws in the end lead to its
subversion? Will the mechanism of the heavens finally
run down as surely as the weights of a clock run down
to their lowest position, or are we authorized on scientific
grounds to assert the permanent stability of the solar system?
This question has been earnestly discussed by the
most distinguished astronomers since the days of Newton.
Until recently, the general conclusion&mdash;reached mainly on
mathematical grounds&mdash;seems to have been that the universe
is a thoroughly conservative system, and that the celestial
machinery by a species of perpetual motion will
run on forever. But must not all applied mathematical
reasoning obtain its data from the exact observation of
material facts? The mathematician must also be a good
natural philosopher; he must lay his account with all
the facts of the universe, otherwise his symbols have no
contents, and his reasoning, however faultless in its processes,
will be fallacious in its results. The discoveries of
the present century respecting the correlation of the va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>rious
forms of energy, the nature of the solar light and
heat, the motions of comets, and especially the new doctrine
of the "Dissipation of Energy," have introduced new
elements into the great problem, which seem to indicate
that gravitation is by no means the only force by which
the motions of the heavenly bodies are influenced, and
that causes are now in operation which are slowly but surely
undermining the system. We now find, therefore, such
high authorities as Whewell, Sir John Herschel, Sir William
Thomson, Balfour Stewart, Prof. Maxwell, Dr. J. R.
Mayer, Helmholtz, Tyndall, Littrow, Comte, Adolph Fick,
asserting that the solar system is not a self-winding clock
which may run forever, but that it is a dissipative system
which must ultimately lose all motion, unless some power
capable of controlling the laws of material nature interfere
to preserve it. We have no more valid reason for
concluding that the Deity intended the system should be
eternal than that He intended the earthly life of man should
be eternal.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> A few general statements may assist the reader
in appreciating the merits of the discussion.</p>

<p>It has been observed since the dawn of science that
changes are taking place in the motions of the heavenly
bodies. The eccentricity of the earth's orbit has been gradually
diminishing from the earliest observations to the present
time. The moon, also, has been moving faster and faster
from the time of the first recorded eclipses, and is now
in advance by about four times her own breadth of what
her place would have been had she not been affected by
these accelerations.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In a few thousand years she will be
half a month ahead of the place she would be in if her
month were to remain constant. The moon is, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
approaching closer and closer to the earth; and if these
changes go on uninterruptedly, without any reaction or
adjustment, sooner or later the final catastrophe must
come, and the moon be precipitated on the body of the
earth.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the last century, Laplace, in his
great work, the "Méchanique Céleste," attempted by certain
mathematical computations to show that, nevertheless,
the solar system is stable and permanent. The planets,
by their mutual attractions, produce perpetual perturbations
in one another's movements. Laplace believed he
could prove that these were periodic; they reach a maximum
value and then diminish, oscillating between very
narrow extremes. He therefore taught that the machine
would go on by a kind of perpetual motion, without any
winding up or adjustment from without; and, consequently,
the eternal continuance of the solar system is insured.</p>

<p>All the investigations of Laplace, and the computations
of Lagrange, proceeded on two assumptions: first, that the
planets are moving <i>in vacuo</i>; and, secondly, that they are
solid throughout their entire mass. The latter assumption
is certainly in conflict with well-determined geological
facts; and there is no <i>à priori</i> ground for assuming that
the planetary spaces are void and empty. On the contrary,
the general analogies of nature would lead us to the
very opposite conclusion, and all attempts at producing a
perfect vacuum have hitherto failed. Furthermore, the
great body of modern physicists, and nearly all modern
astronomers, hold that the celestial spaces are filled with a
"material ether," which must by its very nature offer some
resistance to planetary motion.</p>

<p>"Scientific men," says Mayer, "do not doubt the existence
of such an ether." The presence of such "material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
ether&mdash;dense, elastic, and capable of motion&mdash;subject to and
determined by mechanical laws,"<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> is demanded for the explanation
of radiant heat, light, and actinism. No other
theory ever proposed has so beautifully and completely accounted
for all the facts. Its reality must be admitted, until
the positions established by Huyghens, Young, Fresnel,
Foucault, and Fiziau are shown to be untenable. All the
prominent experimental physicists of the present day agree
in teaching that light and heat are transmitted by vibrations
or wave-like motions in a material medium universally
diffused through space, and permeating all material
bodies. Light and heat are the ceaseless thrill which the
distant orbs collectively create in the ether, and which constitute
what has been called the <i>temperature of space</i>. If
the existence of such material medium as the assumed
ether be denied, we can not account in any conceivable
or rational manner for the transmission of light and heat
from the sun. And now, if the space between the celestial
bodies contain no other matter than that necessary for the
transmission of light, "that alone," says Littrow, "is sufficient,
in the course of time, to alter the motion of the
planets, and the arrangements of the solar system itself;
the fall of all the planets and comets into the sun, and the
destruction of the present state of the solar system, must
be the final result of this action."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>But it is further claimed by Helmholtz, Mayer, and
Sir William Thomson that the phenomena presented by
Encke's comet furnish "direct proof" of the existence of
such resisting medium. The observations on this comet
made during the past thirty or forty years show that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
periods of its revolution are continually diminishing at the
rate of 0.11° per revolution of nearly 3-1/3 years. In other
words, the comet's mean distance from the sun is diminishing
by slow and regular degrees. The solution which
Encke himself proposed, and which Herschel informs us
"is generally received,"<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> is that resistance is experienced
from the medium in which the comet moves; such resistance
diminishing its actual velocity and also its centrifugal
force, thus giving the sun greater power to draw it
nearer. It will, therefore, fall into the sun. A similar fate,
says Helmholtz, threatens all the planets. "The analogies
of nature, and the ascertained facts of physical science,
forbid us to doubt that <i>every star</i>, and, indeed, <i>every body
of every kind</i> moving in any part of space, has its relative
motion impeded by the air, gas, vapor, medium, or whatever
we call the substance occupying space immediately
around them, just as the motion of a rifle-bullet is impeded
by the resistance of the air."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>There are also indirect resistances, the effects of tidal
friction, on all bodies which, like the earth, have portions
of their free surfaces covered by liquids, which, so long
as these bodies move relatively to neighboring bodies,
must keep drawing off energy from their relative motions.
"Thus, if we consider the action of the moon on the earth,
with its oceans, lakes, and rivers, we perceive that it must
tend to equalize the period of the earth's rotation on its
axis, and of the revolution of the two bodies about their
centre of inertia; because, so long as these periods differ,
the tidal action of the earth's surface must keep subtracting
energy from their motions."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> As the tidal wave sweeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
over the oceans and rushes into the numerous bays and estuaries,
the motions which it produces in the waters necessarily
involve an expenditure of power or <i>vis viva</i> in
overcoming the resistance from friction. The energy of
motion thus expended must be drawn from the set of machinery
which produces the motions&mdash;that is, from the motion
of revolution of the moon, and the motion of rotation
of the earth. It can not be returned to the machinery,
because all that is not spent in triturating the sand and
other materials composing the ocean-bed, is transformed
into heat and radiated into space.</p>

<p>It is true that in the present state of science we have
not exact data for estimating the relative importance of
tidal friction, and of the resistance of the interstellar medium;
but, whatever it may be, there can be, says Thomson,
"but one ultimate result for such a system as that of
sun and planets if continuing long enough under existing
laws.... That result is <i>the falling together into one mass,
which, although rotating for a time, must in the end come
to rest relatively to the surrounding medium</i>."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Another evidence that the solar system is temporal, and
that the present cosmical order must come to an end, is
found in the fact that the sun is radiating heat into space
in quantities incomparably greater than it receives. If it
were not so, we should receive, on the average, as much
heat from every other quarter of the heavens as from the
sun, and no vicissitudes of temperature would ever occur on
the earth. Now, from what we know of the nature of heat,
it is impossible that the supply contained in the sun should
be inexhaustible. There is no apparent reason why the
sun should form an exception to the fate of all fires, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
only difference being one of size and time. It is larger
and hotter than ordinary lamps, but is nevertheless a lamp
in which invisible molecular energy is consumed, and consumed,
too, at a rate which baffles all conception. From
every square foot of its surface the sun gives out energy
equal in amount to seven thousand horse-power. The
total amount of heat sent off from the sun in <i>one minute</i>
is "five thousand millions of millions of units": a unit of
heat being the quantity of heat required to raise one kilogramme&mdash;or
about one quart&mdash;of water one Centigrade
degree.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> This enormous consumption of energy must
finally exhaust the original stock. Were the sun a solid
block of coal, and were it allowed a sufficient quantity of
oxygen to enable it to burn at the rate necessary to produce
the observed emission of heat, it would be utterly
consumed in five thousand years. Or if we suppose, with
Thomson, that the initial form of the energy of the universe
is the potential energy of gravitation in matter diffused
through space, and if this potential energy (energy
of position) is transformed into heat (molecular kinetic
energy) by condensation or contraction of the sun, and this
energy of molecular motion (heat) is again transformed
into radiant energy and diffused through infinite space, it
is obvious that this condensation can not be continued forever,
and Thomson has shown in his article on the "Age
of the Sun's Heat" that its power of radiation must come
to an end. Various theories have been suggested for replenishing
the solar heat, one of the most plausible of
which is the falling of meteoric and cometary bodies into
the sun. Prof. Thomson, who was one of the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
adopt this view, has now abandoned it, or at least has denied
its adequacy to account for the maintenance of solar
heat. Even were the hypothesis accepted as valid, the
supply of fuel is still finite. Time will drain the entire
space inclosed by the orbit of the planet Neptune of all
the meteors and comets. Even the planets must at length
be ensepulchred in the sun. "As surely," writes Sir William
Thomson, "as the weights of the clock run down to
the lowest position, from which they can never rise again
unless fresh energy is communicated to them from some
source not yet exhausted, so surely must every planet creep
in, age after age, toward the sun." Not one can escape its
fiery end. And, finally, the heat of the sun itself&mdash;that is,
its molecular energy&mdash;must be transformed into radiant
energy, and diffused and lost as a working force in infinite
space. "Thus do the inexorable laws of mechanics indicate
that the sun's store of heat, which can only suffer loss
and not gain, must <i>be finally exhausted</i>."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>There are thus special geological and astronomical facts
which have long been regarded as indicative of the principle
that the existing order of the material universe is
<i>temporal</i>&mdash;it had a beginning, and must have an end.
But the modern Theory of Energy,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> with its three great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
laws of Conservation, Transformation, and Dissipation,
must be regarded as a comprehensive, complete, and final
settlement of the question. It has been shown, first, that
no system of machinery can <i>create</i> force any more than it
can create matter; and that the amount of energy in the
universe, or in any limited system which does not receive
energy from without, or part with it to external matter, is
a constant or invariable quantity. This is the <i>Law of the
Conservation of Energy</i>. It has been proved, secondly, as
an experimental fact that, in general, one form of energy
may, by suitable processes, be transformed wholly or in part
to an equivalent amount of another form; and the sole
and only function of all possible machines is the conversion
or <i>transformation</i> of energy. This is the <i>Law of
the Transformation of Energy</i>. This law of Transformation
is, however, subject to the limitations which are
imposed by the <i>Law of the Dissipation of Energy</i>, the
discovery of which is mainly due to Sir William Thomson.
He has shown that every machine does its work against
friction. "A material system can never be brought through
any returning cycle of motions without spending more
work against the mutual forces of its parts than it gained
from these parts, because no relative motions can take
place without meeting with frictional or other forms of
resistance." No known process of transformation is exactly
reversible. Whenever an attempt is made to transform
and retransform energy by an imperfect process,
part of the energy is converted into heat, and the heat is
<i>dissipated</i>, so as to become useless because incapable of
further transformation. It therefore follows that, as energy
is constantly in a state of transformation, there is a
constant degradation of energy to that final unavailable
form of uniformly diffused heat; and this will go on as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
long as transformations occur, until the whole energy of
the universe has taken this form.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The reader will find an
extended discussion of this great question in Thomson and
Tait's "Natural Philosophy," vol. i. pp. 188-304, in which
it is shown that the present material system is not a <i>dynamically
conservative</i> but a <i>dissipative</i> system, and therefore
that in such a system "perpetual motion" is an impossibility.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Law of the Dissipation of Energy is an intelligent
and well-supported denial of the chimera of perpetual
motion. There is a loose idea that perpetual motion
is impossible to us, because we can not avoid friction
with its consequent loss of energy, but that nature works
without friction, or that, in general, friction entails no loss,
and so here perpetual motion is possible; but nature no
more works without friction than we do, and friction entails
a loss of available power. The supply of invisible
molecular energy in the sun is no more infinite than the
quantity of matter in the sun is infinite. The sun is daily
lifting huge masses of water from the sea to the skies,
yearly lifting endless vegetation from the earth, setting
breezes and hurricanes in motion, dragging the huge tidal
wave round and round the earth; performing, in short, the
great bulk of the endless labor of this world and other
worlds, so that the energy of the sun is continually being
given away without any corresponding restoration. The
loss of force in the shape of radiant light and heat can
never be weaned back to any other mode of available energy.
Carnot, Clausius, Thomson, and Rankine have all
from different points of view been led to the same conclusion.
We can make no use whatever of the energy repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>sented
by equally diffused heat. If one body is hotter
than another, as the boiler of a steam-engine is hotter than
the condenser, then we can make use of the difference of
temperature to convert some of the heat into work; but
if two substances are equally hot, even though their particles
contain an enormous amount of molecular energy,
they will not yield us a single unit of work. Energy is
thus of different qualities, mechanical energy being the
<i>best</i>, and universal heat the <i>worst</i>; in fact, this latter description
of energy may be compared to the waste heap of
the universe, in which the <i>effete</i> forms of energy are suffered
to accumulate without any further conversion.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> If,
then, when mechanical force passes into heat, <i>some</i> of the
heat can never be brought back to be mechanical force,
and if the change from mechanical force to heat be ever
going on, all the force in the universe must at last take
the form of radiant heat. But if that be so, then at last
all differences of temperature must disappear, and every
thing end in a universal death.</p>

<p>"We are come," says Adolph Fick, "to this alternative:
either in our highest, most general, most fundamental abstractions,
some great point has been overlooked, or the universe
will have an <span class="smcap">END</span>, and must have had a <span class="smcap">BEGINNING</span>;
it could not have existed from Eternity, but must at some
date, not infinitely distant, have arisen from something
not forming a part of the natural chain of causes&mdash;that is,
<span class="smcap">IT MUST HAVE BEEN CREATED</span>."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>


<p>So far, then, the deductions of science are found to be
in striking harmony with the teaching of revelation&mdash;the
existing order of the universe had a beginning; the forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
relations, laws, harmonies of the Cosmos had a commencement
in time. We may now proceed to the consideration
of the second question: Had that which is the <i>ground</i>
of all form, the <i>subject</i> of all changes and relations, a
beginning? Had the <i>matter</i> of the universe a beginning?</p>

<p>That we may fairly present the answer which modern
science offers to this question, we must premise, in general,
that it confesses its inability, in the present stage of physical
knowledge, to determine what is the ultimate or internal
constitution of matter. Many scientists of to-day
are of the opinion expressed by Grove<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> that "probably
man will never know the ultimate structure of matter."
Others, as, for example, Thomson, Bayma, McVicar, and
Challis, entertain the opinion that physical science is competent
to discover all the minutiæ of molecular actions,
and when this has been achieved, the question as to the
ultimate constitution of matter can be finally determined.
There is one guiding principle, recognized alike by the
physicist and the metaphysician, namely, that substances,
ultimate entities, are known, and can only be known in
and through their respective phenomena. An exact enumeration
and careful colligation of all the phenomena are
therefore indispensable prerequisites to the solution of the
problem.</p>

<p>Meantime nothing is more remarkable, even in the
present state of physical science, than the fact that, under
the subtile analysis of modern physics, much that we have
been accustomed to regard as phenomena of matter dissolves
and disappears, surviving only as phenomena of
<i>Force</i>. The phenomena of heat, light, color, sound, electricity,
and magnetism are now "modes of motion"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>&mdash;manifestations
of one and the same omnipresent energy,
which is transferred from one portion of matter to another,
and modified or transformed simply by the mechanical
arrangements and collocations of matter. The
opinion is rapidly gaining ground that even chemical action
is a mode of motion, and Professor Norton does not
hesitate in affirming that "<i>all the phenomena of material
nature result from the action of force upon matter</i>."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
All that we mean by a Material Force "is a force which
acts <i>upon</i> matter, and produces in matter its own appropriate
effects."<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> It is not an attribute of matter, not a
quality inherent in matter, but a mode or state superimposed
upon matter.</p>

<p>There is a large, influential, and daily increasing class
of scientists, among whom may be named Faraday, Prof.
Owen, Dr. Laycock, Wallace, Dr. Winslow, Prof. Huxley,
who do not regard matter as an ultimate entity, and who
believe that all the phenomena of matter (so called), even
extension, resistance, and ultimate incompressibility, may
be resolved into phenomena of force. In other words,
matter is only <i>phenomenal</i>, and, like all phenomena, demands
a <i>cause</i>.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> These men are perplexed with no difficulties
as to the <i>origin</i> of matter. As a phenomenon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
must be a product of Creative Efficiency, and therefore
had a beginning.</p>

<p>It is obviously unnecessary that we should here discuss the
merits of this hypothesis which resolves matter into force.
We shall encounter it at a subsequent stage of our inquiry,
and may then attempt to gauge its merits. It is
enough for our present purpose that Heat, Light, Color,
Sound, Electricity, Magnetism, are recognized as forms
of molecular Energy&mdash;phenomena of Force; that these
forms of invisible molecular energy, together with all the
energy of visible motions and positions, are regarded as
flowing from one great central force, or fountain-head of
power; and that there is a remarkable unanimity among
the first scientific men of our age in acknowledging this
power as the Creative Efficiency of God. These forces
uniformly work in obedience to Law; and Law, whether
viewed in the orderly movement of a planet or an atom,
in the symmetrical arrangement of a crystal of the definite
proportions of chemical combination, in the organization
of a worm or of an elephant, is intellect, is <i>reason</i>.
This is the ultimate principle upon which every condition
of matter and form depends.</p>

<p>This conception of force will materially aid us in the
conception of matter. It is simply "the recipient of impulses
or energy"<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>&mdash;the mere passive condition for the
exercise of power. "It does not generate the phenomena
which it manifests. It is only the substratum&mdash;it does absolutely
nothing but give to the phenomena their conditions
of manifestation."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Every molecule of matter, every
aggregation of molecules, every organism must be regarded
as a machine upon which the forces of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
play, and by which they are transformed and rendered
available for the performance of work. Thus matter, by
its very conception, must have been <i>created</i>, and fitted for
the fulfillment of a predetermined function. Before the
mechanism of the universe was set in motion, there was a
preparation and collocation of its materials, and an adjustment
of its minutest parts. As Sir John Herschel
justly remarks, "Chemical analysis most certainly points
to an origin, and effectually destroys the idea of an external
self-existent matter, by giving to each of its atoms the
essential character, at once, of a <i>manufactured article</i> and
a <i>subordinate agent</i>."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The numerical relations between
chemical elements are the expression of creative ideas.
The maxim of the Pythagorean philosophers is daily receiving
new illustration from science, "The world is a
living arithmetic in its development, a realized geometry
in its repose." There can be no arithmetic without an
Arithmetician, no geometry without a Geometrician.
Thus in the very elements out of which the universe is
built, the blocks of nature's temple, we see the indications
not only of a fashioning but of an <i>originating</i> intelligence&mdash;a
Creating God. Design as truly appears in the
primitive nature of matter as in its secondary formations.
The primitive purpose is stamped on the primitive article.</p>

<p>"Every molecule throughout the universe bears impressed
on it the stamp of a metric system as distinctly as does
the metre of the Archives at Paris, or the double royal cubit
of the Temple of Karnac.</p>

<p>"No theory of evolution can be formed to account for
the similarity of molecules, for evolution necessarily implies
continuous change, and the molecule is incapable of
growth or decay, of generation or destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"None of the processes of Nature, since the time when
Nature began, have produced the slightest difference in the
properties of any molecule. We are therefore unable to
ascribe either the existence of the molecules or the identity
of their properties to the operation of any of the causes
which we call <i>natural</i>.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, the exact quality of each molecule
to all others of the same kind gives it the essential character
of a manufactured article, and <i>precludes the idea of
its being eternal and self-existent</i>."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br/>
CREATION: ITS HISTORY.</h2>


<p>The universe had a beginning. It is not eternal either
in its matter or form; it is neither self-originated nor self-sustained.
The all of the finite, with its relations and laws,
its adaptations and harmonies, had its origin solely and
absolutely in the unconditioned will of God. This is the
Christian doctrine concerning the world.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapters we have endeavored to show
that this doctrine is in perfect agreement with the teachings
of sound philosophy, and we have found that it is
daily receiving fresh confirmation from the discoveries of
modern science.</p>

<p>If the universe originated solely in the free determination
of God, then we are assured there must be a sufficient
and ultimate reason for its existence. This logically follows
from the true conception of <i>Will</i>, for will is not unconscious
force, neither is it groundless arbitrariness, but
conscious, rational choice.</p>

<p>In the merely formal and indifferent sense of the word,
an arbitrary action is one in which the agent yields to the
blind impulse of caprice, and can assign no reason for his
doing. An action is truly free only when the agent knows
<i>what</i> he wills, and <i>why</i> he wills it. The self-conscious will
is the only real will. Will is intrinsically something more
than power, something more, even, than the power of spontaneous
self-determination. Will involves precognition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
deliberation, and alternative choice: it is the living synthesis
of reason and power. "The mere moment of self-determination
does not suffice for the notion of will, for
this, in a certain sense, we must ascribe to unintelligent
creatures, to the organic life of nature by virtue of its development
from its own principle. Self-determination only
thereby becomes will by its being a <i>conscious</i> determination&mdash;that
is, the conscious subject is able to present to its
own mind that which it brings to reality by its self-determination."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
All real volition supposes a purpose or end to
be realized, an inward motive or reason which renders the
end desirable, and the choice and adaptation of means to
accomplish that end. Consequently, if the universe is the
product of the Divine Will, it must, both in its origination
and its history, be the realization of an ultimate or final
purpose, must have a perfect unity of plan; and the highest
law of the universe must be a <i>teleological</i> idea to which all
nature-forces and all causal connections are subordinated.
This ultimate purpose forms, as it were, a complete network
of higher teleological connections above the web of
mere aiteological connections which pervades the universe.</p>

<p>This great principle that a teleological idea is the highest
law of the universe has been recognized by all philosophers
of the spiritualistic school from the time of Plato
to the present day. Even Mr. Mill admits that "Teleology,
or the Doctrine of Ends, may be termed, not improperly,
a principle of the practical reason;"<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and he advises
those who would prove the existence of God "to stick to
the argument from <i>design</i>." No saying of Bacon has been
more often quoted or more grossly misunderstood and misapplied
than his remark on final causes: "The search after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
final causes is barren, for like virgins consecrated to God
they produce nothing." If, however, we refer to his writings
("Advancement of Learning," bk. ii. p. 142), we find him
adding, "<i>not because these final causes are not true and
worthy to be inquired, being kept within their own province</i>."
A fair consideration of the context clearly shows
that the remark was intended to apply to Physics, and not
at all to Metaphysics. All that he intends to say is that in
purely physical inquiries the search after final causes can
have no practical application; and the error he would guard
against is the assumption that what appears to man a final
cause must be the ultimate final cause to the Infinite One.</p>

<p>The belief that a principle of adaptation to special ends
pervades all existence, and that it must be assumed as the
ground of the scientific explanation of the facts and phenomena
of the universe, is avowed by the first scientists
of the age. "We can not be content," says Dr. Laycock,
"with simply determining the mere relations of things or
events&mdash;an existence, a co-existence, a succession, or a resemblance&mdash;and
not inquire into the <i>ends</i> thereof. Such
a doctrine applied to physiology would, in fact, arrest all
scientific research into the phenomena of life; for the investigation
of the so-called functions of organs is nothing
more than a <i>teleological</i> investigation."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> "<i>A law of design
is the higher generalization of the great uniformities of
nature.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> In his inaugural address at the meeting of the
British Association of Science at Edinburgh, Sir William
Thomson said: "I feel profoundly convinced that the argument
from design has been greatly lost sight of in recent
speculations.... Overwhelmingly strong proofs of Intelligence
and Benevolent Design lie all around us; and if ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
perplexities, whether of a metaphysical or scientific character,
turn us away for a time, they will come back upon us
with irresistible force, showing us through nature the influence
of a <i>Free Will</i>, and teaching us that all living beings
depend upon one ever-acting <i>Creator</i> and <i>Ruler</i>."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Every enlargement of our knowledge of organic nature
is an addition to the already numberless instances of recognized
special adaptation which crowd us on every hand;
and all scientific discovery is but an illustration and a verification
of the <i>à priori</i> intuition of the reason that a principle
of design is co-extensive with and the highest law of
the universe. Not merely of each individual existence, but
of the grand totality of existence, are we constrained to
believe that it exists for a purpose. Above all special ends
there is a great ultimate design of creation&mdash;a last or final
end to which all intermediate ends are means; and though
physical science can not fully compass that final purpose,
yet in the light of its present knowledge of special ends
it has abundant reason for assuming that there <i>must</i> be a
final purpose, and that that final purpose is at once beneficent
and wise.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>But while the final purpose of creation may not be discoverable
by human science, we know that it has been revealed
in the Christian Scriptures.</p>

<p>The most fundamental doctrine of Christianity is that
<i>God is Love</i> (1 John iv. 8, 16), and that Love is the highest
determining principle of the Divine efficiency. Creation,
Providence, and Redemption are grounded in Love as the
final cause (Gen. i. 31; Isa. lxiii. 9; John iii. 16).</p>

<p>The gravitating point of the Christian doctrine of "God
the Creator" is not Omnipotence, nor yet Wisdom, but al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>ways
Love. Omnipotence, in itself considered, possesses
no moving or determining principle. God does not create
the world to reveal his infinite power. Infinite Wisdom
devises the best means and methods for the Divine efficiency,
but it does not supply the ultimate reason why the
world exists. The Love of God is the moving principle of
his wisdom and power in that it appoints the <i>end</i> to which
omnipotence is related as the efficient, and wisdom as the
formal cause. Whatever displays of power or of wisdom
may be made in the created universe, they are all subordinated
and made subservient to the purpose of Love. The
highest law of the universe is Love. "The conservation
of Love is the loftiest conservation of Force."</p>

<p>The world, then, was created to be a revelation of God,
and especially to be a revelation of the perfections of the
Divine nature which are grounded in and deducible from
Love; and it exists as the self-manifestation and self-communication
of God to personal creatures who can know
Him and love Him in return. "That which can determine
God, absolutely sufficient in Himself, in the production of
beings distinct from Himself, is <i>Love alone</i>; consequently
the creation is nothing else than the free self-communication
of God Himself, who could be exclusively in Himself,
but wills that others may have being and, in fellowship
with Him, eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The world-creating, world-preserving
Love of God has this for its ultimate purpose, <i>that
there shall be beings who, in the completeness and perfection
of personal existence, shall know and love and resemble
God, and have fellowship in his blessedness and joy</i>
(Matt. v. 8; 1 Cor. xiii. 12; 2 Peter i. 4; 1 John iii. 2).</p>

<p>The realization of a perfected humanity in fellowship
with God is, then, the final end of creation. We find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
intimations of this grand purpose in the sublime record of
creation which is given by Moses. We there learn that
every thing was created with a view to man&mdash;to "man in
the image of God." The inorganic world exists for the
vegetable kingdom, the vegetable exists for the animal
kingdom, and all exists for man (ch. i. 26-30). All its successive
changes were a preparation for the appearance of
man.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The more comprehensive revelation of the New
Testament teaches that man exists for the realization of
that perfected humanity of which Christ is the model, and
which is attained in and through Christianity. The idea
of man is the teleological principle of the world, the idea
of Christ is the teleological principle of humanity. All
things were created <i>by</i> Christ and for Christ. "The good
pleasure (εὐδοκία = the benevolent purpose) of the Divine
Will" is, in the fullness of time, to gather together in one
all things both which are in heaven and which are on earth,
even in Christ, that in the final consummation <i>God may
be all in all</i> (Eph. i. 9, 10; 1 Cor. xv. 28).</p>

<p>This purpose of Divine Love is an "<i>eternal purpose</i>," ordained
before the foundation of the world, and progressively
unfolded in the creation, government, and redemption
of the world. Thus the world, as an actual, temporal
world, reposes on an eternal ideal world which has always
been present to the Divine cognition. The visible creation
is but the realization of the Divine ideal in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
modes and under such conditions as shall constitute it a
manifestation of God to finite intelligences&mdash;the external
expression of the mind and character of God, the language
of the Deity.</p>


<p>Assuming this as a fundamental principle of Christian
theology that Creation is the self-manifestation of God,
and that the final cause of this manifestation is the communication
of the Divine blessedness to intelligent, personal
being, we may logically infer the following intermediate
principles as <i>Laws of this Manifestation</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>This manifestation must be</i> <span class="smcap">GRADUAL</span>, <i>not instantaneous.
In other words, it must be unfolded in successive
steps or phases, so as to be adapted to the nature and capabilities
of the being to whom it is made. The determinations
of nature, like those of consciousness, must
conform to the law of progressive development.</i></p>

<p>Divine omnipotence was, no doubt, adequate to the production
of new beings without any pre-existing materials
or any prearranged conditions; but creation is not mainly
or primarily a revelation of omnipotence. The Deity
might have brought the phenomena of the universe into
instant being without any succession and independent of
all means, but a universe thus instantaneously produced
and simultaneously presented would reveal no purpose to,
and could not be understood by, a finite mind. Finite consciousness
can be developed only under conditions of plurality,
difference, and succession, and therefore the objects
of cognition must be successively presented. We may be
sensible of the external reality by immediate intuition, but
we can <i>understand</i> only through experience; and experience
supposes a gradual process&mdash;a succession not simply in our
mental states, but a succession of external phenomena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
This experience of succession constitutes our consciousness
of <i>time</i>. Therefore, in order that the Divine manifestation
may be understood, it must have a <i>history</i>.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>This manifestation must be</i> <span class="smcap">CUMULATIVE</span>&mdash;<i>that is, it
must afford an increase of knowledge through successive
additions; it must be an advancing revelation of new
principles and laws in an ascending line of creative acts.</i></p>

<p>An evolution which is absolutely continuous, and in
which the present is the necessary outcome of the past, and
that by degrees infinitely small, may be a manifestation of
unconscious force, but can not be a manifestation of living
Will. If nature be a manifestation of God&mdash;the unfolding
of an eternal purpose of Love&mdash;this manifestation must
ever be open to receive <i>new</i> additions, the intercalation of
new principles, and the superinduction of new laws working
for a nobler end. All limitations from the scientific
stand-point are illogical and absurd. This law would determine
our conception of the universe as an aggregation
of combined evolutions from several intermediate principles
or beginnings, rather than an evolution from a single first
matter or first force. <i>The creation of the new</i>, whether as
primordial element, or primary force, or principle of life,
or rational soul, is the fundamental idea of the <i>supernatural</i>&mdash;that
is, the production of something which is not a
necessary out-birth from pre-existing conditions and laws.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
Therefore what is commonly, though perhaps incorrectly,
styled "miraculous interposition," must itself be a law of
the Divine manifestation, and the law of uniformity must
be subordinated to the more general law of progressive
development, which subordinates the inorganic to the organic,
the physical to the moral world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>This manifestation must be</i> <span class="smcap">CONSECUTIVE</span>. <i>Not only
must it be a succession of steps or phases, but the entire
series must be so related and concatenated as to present
an Order of Thought&mdash;an ascending development toward
a foreseen and predetermined end.</i></p>

<p>If it were not so, every thing would be <i>isolated</i> and <i>disconnected</i>,
and consequently unintelligible. There would
be a succession of phenomena, but no manifestation of
thought; a series of dissolving views presented to the sense,
but no revelation to the understanding. Isolated phenomenal
changes might be continued through untold ages, but
the past would have no connection with the present, and
would be unknown and lost to all the future. A revelation
of the Infinite Mind to finite intelligences, made
through the manifold and diversified phenomena of nature,
must be a connected and related whole, so that from
phenomena actually observed we may infer antecedent
conditions, and anticipate future evolutions; otherwise it
could not be understood. To be intelligible, a process of
development must be the product of thought, and it must
reveal thought&mdash;that is, it must be <i>consecutive</i>.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>4. <i>This manifestation must be</i> <span class="smcap">HARMONIOUS</span>. <i>Notwithstanding
its multiplicity of parts and manifold stages,
it must be a unity&mdash;a Cosmos.</i></p>

<p>Beings the most varied in endowment, things the most
diversified in form and function, events the most remote
from each other in time and space, must all be related
and connected in virtue of the ultimate and all-embracing
purpose for which the universe exists. An external purpose
revealed under time-relations must be an <i>all-harmonious
evolution</i> and an <i>orderly totality</i>&mdash;a Cosmos.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the record of creation as given in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the Sacred Scriptures&mdash;the Mosaic Cosmogony&mdash;and see
how that account conforms to the laws which on logical
grounds we have deduced as the Laws of the Divine
Manifestation.</p>

<p>The fundamental prerequisite for a right interpretation
of the sacred narrative is a clear apprehension, first, of its
general purpose, and, secondly, of its special literary characteristics.
On these two points, therefore, we offer the
following preliminary considerations:</p>

<p>1. <i>The design of the sacred narrative is to teach Theology
and not Science.</i> A cursory reading of the narrative
will convince any one that its purpose is not to enlarge
men's views of nature, but to teach them something
concerning nature's God. It says nothing about the
forces of nature, the laws of nature, the classifications of
natural history, or the size, positions, distances, and motions
of the heavenly bodies. From first to last, every phenomenon
and every law is linked immediately to some act or
command of God. It is God who creates, God who commands,
God who names, God who approves, and God who
blesses. Strike out the allusions to God, and the narrative
is meaningless. Clearly, it was never intended to teach
science. It has obviously one purpose, to reveal and keep
before the minds of men the grand truth <i>that Jehovah is
the sole Creator and Lord of the heavens and the earth</i>;
and it leaves the scientific comprehension of nature to
the natural powers with which God has endowed man
for that end.</p>

<p>All this is what we might legitimately expect. The
narrative was designed primarily and mainly for the instruction
of the masses of men who knew nothing or
scarcely any thing of science; and if designed for their
instruction, it must be couched in language which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
could comprehend. A revelation made in the language
of science would have been unintelligible to the race for
nearly six thousand years of its history, and, practically,
would have been no revelation at all. Scientific language,
moreover, is subject to modification and change as
science advances; but the narrative of Genesis was intended
for all time, and therefore needed to be couched
in language not liable to change. "The only language
which possesses these two requisites of general intelligibility
and non-liability to change is the <i>language of appearances</i>.
The facts set forth must be described as they
would have seemed to the eye of man; that is, in a word,
phenomenally, or the cosmogony would fail of its purpose.
All scrutiny or objection in the matter of unscientific, or
scientifically inaccurate language, then, must be put aside
as irrelevant."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>While earnestly maintaining that the inspired history of
creation was given for the instruction of unscientific persons,
and is therefore theological and not scientific, we also
believe that all truth is one, and that all revelation, whether
in Scripture or in nature, must be ultimately harmonious.
Science in its last generalization must be Theology.
Theology in its proper development must be Science.
They are twin children of heaven, vestal virgins which
can not be wedded to error. We are, therefore, justified
in the expectation that the revelation in Scripture, when
rightly interpreted, will contain nothing that is inconsistent
with the scientific interpretation of nature. While
we hold that there are no untimely anticipations of scientific
discovery in Genesis, yet we expect that when the
scientific discoveries are made, the congruity and dignity
of the moral and religious lesson shall not be defeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and marred. Nay, more, we maintain that the Mosaic
cosmogony presents the great principles which really lie
at the basis of a truly scientific interpretation of nature.
It teaches that God is before all things and the Creator
of all things&mdash;that He alone is unbeginning, and that all
things had a beginning in his creative word and will. It
presents the universe as one harmonious whole, the product
of one designing Mind, the project of his thought, the
transcript of his plan&mdash;a plan evolved through successive
stages toward a foreseen terminus or goal. And, finally,
it teaches that man is the end toward which creation was
tending, that he is the last and crowning work of God, and
that he is the child and charge, not of a blind, impersonal
force, but of a living, loving God.</p>

<p>2. <i>The sacred narrative is poetic, symbolical, and unchronological.</i>
It is a noteworthy fact that the early literature
of the most ancient nations was poetic&mdash;the natural,
spontaneous product of that earliest stage of mental
development in which the conceptions of God and of nature
were determined by subjective feeling and native sentiment,
and not by reflective thought. The "Vedas" of
the Hindus, the "Iliad" of the Greeks, the "Eddas" of the
ancient Germans, were each the product of an age in which
"prose was unknown, as well as the distinction between
prose and poetry." The earliest Hebrew compositions
are of the same character; and it is reasonable to assume
that a primitive revelation to the progenitors of our race
would be accommodated to this earliest phase in the development
of mind.</p>

<p>The Book of Genesis opens with a <i>Psalm</i>&mdash;"the inspired
Psalm of Creation"<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>&mdash;"a grand symbolical Hymn
of Creation." "The rhythmical character of the passage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
its stately style, its parallelisms, its refrains, its unity within
itself, all combine to show that it is a <i>poem</i>."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Here
is the same organic unity which marks the 104th Psalm,
or the Lord's Prayer, or the parable of the laborers in the
vineyard. Or, if we go out of the Bible for illustration,
it combines with lyric breadth of treatment and stateliness
of movement all the compactness of a "solemn sonnet
freighted with a single thought from beginning to end."
Analysis of its interior structure exhibits a most artificial
synthesis, founded upon well-known sacred numbers. It
has, first, an <i>Exordium</i>, the proemial part. Then it is articulated
into six <i>Strophes</i>. Finally there is the <i>Epode</i>,
or peroration. The six strophes separate naturally into
two groups, in which there is a balance and correlation of
parts celebrating the first three and the last three concordant
steps in the creative movement&mdash;the <i>Strophe</i> and the
<i>Antistrophe</i>.</p>

<p>The exordium states briefly the subject of the poem:
"In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth."</p>

<p>The first three strophes unfold the creative development
of the receptacles:</p>

<p>
1. A. The luminiferous ether.                      } "The heavens<br />
2. B. Waters and the firmament between the waters. } and the earth."<br />
3. C. Dry land above the waters, with plants.      }<br />
</p>

<p>The second three strophes (or, more correctly, antistrophes)
unfold the creative development of the occupants:</p>

<p>
4. A. The light-bearers: sun, moon, and stars. } "And all the hosts<br />
5. B. Water-animals and birds.                 } of them" (Gen. ii. 1).<br />
6. C. Land-animals and man.                    }<br />
</p>

<p>The epode, or peroration, fills up the sacred number 7<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>&mdash;the symbol always of permanence and repose. "Thus
the heavens and the earth (the receptacles) were finished,
and all the host of them (the occupants); and on the
seventh day God put period to the work which he created
by fashioning," etc.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Who can read this sublime composition without feeling
that it is "a solemn sonnet freighted with a single thought
from beginning to end?" In our English Bible, broken
up into verses, and split across into two chapters, it is like
an image reflected in a shattered mirror; all its real beauty
is concealed. But he who can look upon it with a clear
eye, and grasp its real unity, must recognize it as a Sacred
Hymn composed probably by Adam, and chanted in the
tents of the patriarchs at their morning and evening devotions
for more than two thousand years, to commemorate
the fact and keep alive the faith that <i>the world is
the work of the triune God</i>.</p>

<p>Besides being poetic, the sacred narrative is pre-eminently
<i>symbolical</i>&mdash;must be symbolical, because the Divine
reality could never be intuitively known. The facts
transcend all the possibilities of human experience. Whatever
knowledge the writer had in regard to the creative
process must have been obtained in a preternatural way&mdash;that
is, it must have been revealed by Divine Omniscience.
But such a revelation could not have been communicated
in mere vocables. Words are themselves but signs&mdash;mere
arbitrary signs of images and ideas&mdash;and can convey no
meaning unless the image or the idea be already before
the mind. The only natural hypothesis is that the knowledge
was conveyed in a symbolic representation&mdash;a vision
of the past in a succession of scenic representations with
accompanying verbal announcements, like the visions of
the future in the prophecies of Ezekiel and the apocalypse
of John. The original formless nebula&mdash;the primeval
darkness&mdash;the brooding Spirit producing motion&mdash;the consequent
luminosity&mdash;the separation of the aeriform fluid
into atmosphere and water&mdash;the emergence of the solid
land&mdash;the shooting forth of grass and plants&mdash;the appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>ance
of the heavenly luminaries&mdash;the swarming of the
waters with living things, and the appearance of birds
of wing in the expanse of heaven&mdash;the bringing forth of
land-animals&mdash;and, finally, the creation of man&mdash;all pass
before his mind in a succession of pictorial representations
of the actual progress of creation. "The sights
seen, the voices heard, the emotions aroused, are just those
adapted to bring out the very words the <i>seer</i> actually uses,
and in both cases the very best words that could have
been used for such a purpose. The description being
given from the barely optical rather than from any reflective
scientific stand-point more or less advanced, is on
this very account the more vivid as well as the more universal.
It is a language read and understood by all."
The words of the inspired writer are descriptive of the
"vision pictures," and these were symbolic representations
of the Divine realities.</p>

<p>The language of the sacred record must therefore be
regarded as <i>anthropopathic</i>&mdash;the Divine idea being symbolized
under the figure of human acts and affections; and
from the analogy between the human and the Divine we
may conceive not what God is in Himself, nor yet the manner
of the Divine action, but the relation of God to the
world. We must, however, guard against substituting the
human symbol for the Divine reality, and making the human
analogy a measure for the infinite Being. "The Sacred
Hymn is no more a <i>literal</i> detail of the actual process
of creation than the description of the New Jerusalem
in Revelation is a <i>literal</i> picture of the heavenly
state."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> God is forever above all finite relations. Finite
acts and relations may be employed as representative symbols
of the Divine, but they can never be adequate repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>sentations.
Divine creating and moving, commanding and
naming, seeing and approving, working and resting, must
not be narrowed down to the standard of our finite personality,
and conceived under human limitations. The
conception of the Deity as standing outside of matter, and
moving and fashioning it after the manner of a human
artificer, as commanding and naming in human language,
as being conditioned in his action by the time-measures
which He himself appointed, as expending energy and
then resting after the manner of a human laborer, is the
rudest anthropomorphism. God is eternal; neither his
being nor his action are conditioned by finite measures of
time. God is absolute immensity, essential omnipresence.
He is "in all and through all" as truly as He is "above
and before all." He is a Living Power immanent in all
matter, as well as transcending all matter, moving it, organizing
it, vitalizing it continually&mdash;a Living Power working
from <i>within</i>, rather than a mechanical force acting
from <i>without</i>.</p>

<p>If the primitive composition standing at the commencement
of Genesis be "the Symbolical Hymn of Creation,"
we are not permitted to regard it as <i>chronological</i>&mdash;that
is, we are not justified in expecting that it shall conform
to time-measures which had no existence prior to the creative
act, but which were consequent upon and determined
by the creative act. This is obvious both from the
nature of things and the character of the composition.</p>

<p>The 106th Psalm is an epic poem&mdash;that is, it is a narrative
in poetic measure, a history in metrical form. Who will
be so unreasonable as to demand that this Psalm shall
furnish any chronological data, or conform to any time-measures
whatever? Psalms are composed to be sung and
excite emotion, not to be merely read and criticised. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
poet groups his materials for the best moral effect, and arranges
his numbers to secure rhythm and harmony. It
is simply absurd to demand that there shall be any chronology&mdash;nay,
it spoils the grand effect to think of chronology
in reading the "Symbolical Hymn of Creation."
In fact, we are forbidden to think of time at all by the
first word of the exordium, which states the subject of
the poem. The Hebrew <i>bereshith</i>, the Greek ἐν ἀρχῆ = in
Beginning (not in <i>the</i> Beginning, for the article is not
used), has <i>no relation to succession in time</i>. It denotes
<i>pretemporality</i>, and is rendered by Meyer, Keil, and
others&mdash;"before time or in eternity." It is the same
thought which is presented in John i. 1: "In the beginning
was the Word;" and Tholuck and Dean Alford both
read the text, "<i>Before the world was, or before time
was</i>." Indeed, the whole poem represents an ideal conception,
and not a time-march of phenomena. So assured
are we on this point that we confidently affirm that
no one who endeavors to think of the creation in its relation
to God can ever fall into the anthropomorphic error
of saying that "God's ways are like unto our ways,"
"God's speaking is like unto our speaking," "God's working
and resting are like unto our working and resting,"
and "God's days are like unto our days of twenty-four
hours." As Dr. Whedon remarks, "Our traditional unscientific
scientific constructions of this chapter are Japhetic
interpretations of a Semitic text."</p>

<p>The men who persist in regarding "the day of God"
as a natural day of twenty-four hours are involved in numberless
inconsistencies when they attempt to carry their
rigid preconception throughout the whole Bible. Human
or finite measures of time, when applied to any
thing God does, can only be accommodated representa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tions
to meet our feeble comprehension, and we are constantly
guarded, in the Bible itself, against a literal and
anthropomorphic conception. "Hast thou eyes of flesh, or
seest thou as man seeth? Are thy days as man's days?"
(Job x. 4, 5.) To say that God's days of working are like
our days is just as absurd and as degrading a conception
as to say that God's eyes are "eyes of flesh," like ours.
Our time-measures can not condition the Divine action.
"One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
thousand years as one day" (2 Peter iii. 8); which means
that time is as nothing with God, that time does not condition
the Divine life or the Divine action, but that it is
the Divine action which makes and conditions all time.
<i>The beginning of the world is the beginning of time</i>, and
time is the duration of the world measured into equal parts
by the equable motion of bodies in space.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The attempt
to measure the creating work of God by days of twenty-four
hours is just as absurd as the attempt to measure immensity
by a three-foot rule, or to estimate omnipotence
by horse-power.</p>

<p>Let any one test the twenty-four-hour measure on such
texts as the following: "Your father Abraham desired to
see my <i>day</i>." "The <i>day</i> of the Son of Man." "I must
work the works of him that sent me while it is <i>day</i>." "If
thou hadst known in this thy <i>day</i>." "He shall rise again
in the resurrection at the last <i>day</i>." "The <i>day</i> of salvation."
"The <i>day</i> of judgment." "The terrible <i>day</i> of the
Lord." It would be a wholesome and profitable exercise to
take up the Concordance and refer to all the texts in which
the word "day" stands in any relation to the determina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>tions
or doings of God, and it will be found that it is always
an indefinite period of longer or shorter duration,
and may be twenty-four hundred years, or twenty-four
thousand years, just as well as twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The Hebrew יום (yom), first occurring in Gen. i. 5, is
the name of an indefinite period, a cycle of time radically
grounded on the primitive conception of division or separation.
Light is the first <i>separation</i>. It is "divided
from the darkness." "And God called the light <i>day</i>, and
the darkness He called <i>night</i>." This is God's own naming,
and we must take it as our guide in the interpretation
of the subsequent "days." Obviously, it is not the duration,
but the phenomenon, the appearing itself which is for
the first time called day. Then the term is used for a
period, or the whole first cycle of events, with its two great
antithetical parts&mdash;"And there was an evening, and there
was a morning, <i>one day</i>." We look into the sacred narrative
to see what corresponds to this naming. What was the
night? Certainly the <i>darkness</i> on the face of the waters.
What was the day? Certainly the <i>light</i> consequent on the
brooding of the Spirit and the commanding word. How
long was the day? How long was the night or the darkness?
The account tells us nothing about it. There is something
on the face of it which seems to forbid such questions.
Where are we to get twelve hours for this first night?
Where is the point of commencement when darkness began
to be on the face of the deep? All is vast, sublime,
immeasurable. The time is as formless as the material.
It has, indeed, a chronology of some kind, but on a scale
vastly different from that afterward appointed (ver. 14) to
regulate the history of a completed and habitable world.
Whoever thinks seriously on the impossibility of accommodating
this first day to the measure of twenty-four hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
needs no other argument. The first day is, in this respect,
the model of all the rest.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>It is equally impossible to reduce the "seventh day" to
a chronological standard of twenty-four hours. "And God
rested on the seventh day from all his works which He had
made." Are we to presume that God "rested" as we rest,
because He was weary, and that He needed to rest just
twenty-four hours? Is not God "resting" still in the sense
in which the word "rest" is here used, viz., <i>to cease doing</i>
a particular work? Is not all time since the Creation
God's grand Sabbath, in which he is not doing works of
Origination, but works of Love and Mercy to our race?</p>

<p>It is obvious that the first and the seventh days can not
be days of twenty-four hours; and, furthermore, a clear apprehension
of the nature of the first day must open to us
the true conception of all the rest. The days are <i>new appearances,
new manifestations, new developments</i> in the
Creative Week&mdash;the great <i>day</i> of God (Gen. ii. 4). According
to the analogy of the first day, the evening is the
time of a peculiar or partially chaotic condition, like the
glacial epoch which closed the Cenozoic and opened the
Phrenozoic day. The morning is a <i>new evolution of a
new order of things</i>, which carries the world-formation to
a higher stage. With each creative morning there comes
a higher, fairer, richer state of the earth, until it reaches
the Sabbath of the world, the day on which God rested
or ceased from his world-creating work, that He might
educate and recreate and redeem and glorify the human
race.</p>

<p>In these antithetical movements of each creative day we
are not necessitated to assume a sudden catastrophe, or any
return to the chaos of the first day, any more than we now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
conceive of night as a sudden return to darkness, or of day
as the sudden return of light. There is a steady progression,
an orderly movement in the history of each creative
day, just as there is in the history of a single solar day.
The light does not break suddenly upon the world&mdash;the sun
rises gradually upon the earth. And so the creative day
was a slow development, a gradual evolution out of a prior
order of things, by the direct efficiency of God.</p>

<p>It has been insinuated that this is an interpretation which
has been forced upon us by the progress of modern science.
Theology, it is said, has been perpetually driven from her
positions by science, and is now compelled to take refuge
in subterfuge and equivocation. The insinuation is as
false as it is foul. This mode of interpretation was propounded
ages before the science of Geology was known,
and was taught by Jewish doctors and Christian fathers
for fifteen hundred years. St. Augustine, the father of
Systematic Theology, who was born A.D. 354, asks the
question, "What mean these days&mdash;these strange sunless
days? Does the enumeration of days and nights avail
for a distinction between the nature that is not yet formed,
and those which are made, so that they shall be called
morning <i>propter speciem</i> [<i>i. e.</i>, in reference to appearing,
receiving form or species], and evening <i>propter privationem</i>
[<i>i. e.</i>, in reference to non-appearance, formlessness, and
want of sensible quality]?" ("De Genesi ad Literam," lib.
ii. ch. 14.) Hence he does not hesitate to call them <i>naturæ</i>,
natures, births or growths; also <i>moræ</i>, delays, or solemn
pauses in the Divine work. They are <i>dies ineffabiles</i>;
their true nature can not be told. Hence they are called
days as the best symbol by which the idea could be expressed.
They are God-divided days and nights in distinction
from sun-divided. Common solar days are mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<i>vicissitudines coeli</i>, mere changes in the positions of the
heavenly bodies, and not <i>spatia morarum</i>, or evolutions in
nature belonging to a higher chronology, and marking
their epochs by a law of inward change instead of incidental
outward measurement. As to how long or how
short they were he gives no opinion, but contents himself
with maintaining that <i>day is not a name of duration</i>, the
evenings and the mornings are to be regarded not so much
as measuring the passing of time (<i>temporis præteritionem</i>)
as marking the boundaries of a periodic work or evolution.
This is not the metaphorical, but the real and proper sense
of the word <i>day</i>, in fact the original sense, inasmuch as it
contains the idea of rounded periodicity or self-completed
time, without any of the mere accidents that belong to the
outwardly measured solar or planetary epochs, be they
longer or shorter.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>These are not the mere fancies of St. Augustine. This
was the doctrine of the ablest Christian fathers&mdash;of Irenæus,
Origen, Basil, and Gregory of Nazianzen. Nay more, it
was the doctrine of many of the doctors of the old Jewish
Church. In more recent times we find Calmet, Burnet,
Stillingfleet, Henry More, Lord Bacon, Poole, and others,
presenting similar views; and this long before Geology
existed as a science, and irrespective of any supposed collision
with physical induction. Their opinions and interpretations
were therefore no shift for the avoidance of
difficulties, but conclusions reached independently on sound
principles of Biblical exegesis.</p>

<p>Disregarding the chronology of Archbishop Usher printed
in the margin of our Bible, and the division into chapters
and verses made by Hugh de St. Cher&mdash;both modern
inventions which are no part of the sacred record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>&mdash;and
purging our minds of those prepossessions which are
incident to an uncritical faith, we can now contemplate
the Symbolical Hymn of Creation in its simple and original
form, as a record of the <i>self-manifestation of God</i>,
given in such order and under such conditions that it shall
be apprehensible and interpretable by the finite mind.</p>

<p>1. <i>Creation was a gradual process.</i> God did not create
a perfect universe at once, but built it up slowly, step by
step. A consistent interpretation of the record forbids us
to regard "the Creative Week" as a literal week composed
of days of twenty-four hours each. Creation is the work
of God, and surely the Divine action can not have been
conditioned by time-measures which did not exist before,
but were consequent upon the act of God. The great cyclical
changes in nature produced by the creative Word are
the only measures of time. Therefore the "days" of the
Creative Week are <i>new appearances, new manifestations,
new developments</i> in the creative purpose of God.</p>

<p>The first morning is the appearance of <i>luminosity</i> in
the aeriform fluid, or nebulous vapor, whatever science
may finally determine that to have been. The Hebrew
מַיִם (mayim), from the root ים, which denotes <i>tumultuous</i>,
<i>tremulous</i>, or <i>undulatory</i> movement, is used of the waters
of the ocean, of the waters above the firmament, of
vapor and clouds, because of their susceptibility of tremulous,
undulatory motion. The first distinct creative formation
was <i>heat</i>, or invisible molecular motion, resulting
from "the Spirit of God brooding upon the face of the
abyss;" and this heat reveals itself in the phenomena of
<i>light</i>.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> How closely the ideas of light and heat were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
united in the Hebrew mind is shown by the same word
being used for both, with merely a slight difference in
pronunciation, אוֹר (ōr) and אוּר (ūr).</p>

<p>The second morning is the appearance of an <i>expanse</i>
in the midst of the vapors, dividing the vapors which were
below the expanse from the vapors which were above the
expanse. The Hebrew רֳקִיֹעַ (rakai), from רֳקַע (to stretch,
to spread out), means properly an extension, an expanse.
This is the translation adopted by Benisch, Kalisch, Delitzsch,
Keil, and Lange. After heat and light, the next
creative formation is an <i>atmosphere</i>, with its auroral light
and a cloudy canopy.</p>

<p>The third morning is the appearance of <i>land</i> and <i>seas</i>,
and the sprouting forth of <i>vegetation</i>, at first in its lowest
forms&mdash;perhaps as marine plants. The Hebrew אֶרֶץ
(eretz) has two significations, "earth" and "land." Whenever
it is used in a restricted sense, and especially wherever
it is contrasted with "water," the most appropriate
rendering is "land." The third creative formation is
<i>gross, ponderable matter</i>, whether aggregated by molecular
attraction, or compounded by elective affinity, or selected
and organized by vital force.</p>

<p>The fourth morning is the appearance of <i>luminaries</i> or
<i>light-bearers</i> in the expanse of heaven, which are now
"set," or, more correctly, "appointed to give light upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the earth," and to be time-measures in the future world-history.
The Hebrew word employed in ver. 14 (מְארֹת),
which is unfortunately rendered "lights" in the Authorized
Version, is a different word from the "light" (אוֹר) of
vers. 3-5. מְארֹת (meoroth) strictly means "light-bearers,"
or bodies giving light. This distinction is carefully observed
in the LXX., DeWette, Benisch, Kalisch, Tuch, Knobel,
Delitzsch, and Keil.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The fourth creative formation
was the establishment of such cosmical conditions or relations
as should enable the heavenly bodies to fulfill their
light-giving function to the earth. What those conditions
were we may not be able to say. The dense clouds and
ceaseless showers of the "Age of Rain," which had shut
out the light of the heavenly bodies for a geological age,
had now passed away, the atmosphere becomes fitted for
the transmission of light, and the sun, moon, and stars are
visible from the earth. The conditions for a rapid development
of vegetable life now exist, and this is regarded
as pre-eminently "the Age of Plant-growth."</p>

<p>The fifth morning is the appearance of <i>animal life</i>&mdash;life
moving in the waters and soaring in the air, marine
animals, aquatic reptiles, and birds.</p>

<p>The sixth morning is the appearance of a higher order
of animal life, <i>mammals</i>, chiefly designed for the use of a
still higher being&mdash;for <i>Man</i>, whose appearance is the noontide
splendor of the sixth day.</p>

<p>The seventh morning is the commencement of the <i>Sabbath
of God</i>, which is devoted to the moral and religious
instruction of humanity&mdash;the New Creation of the moral
world.</p>

<p>The following scheme, furnished by Dr. Winchell, presents
at one view the order of the Mosaic record, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the same time sets forth the harmony between the <i>Mosaic</i>
and <i>Geologic</i> records:<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>2. Creation was <i>cumulative</i>&mdash;that is, it was a succession
of beginnings or creative epochs, in which new entities
or new forces were inserted into the already existing
sphere of nature, carrying it forward toward a nobler
end.</p>

<p>This, we think, is the natural impression which the reading
of Gen. i. makes on the unbiased mind. Each creative
word appears as the dynamical basis of a real <i>principium</i>&mdash;a
beginning of something intrinsically new, and
which can not be conceived as the physical result of any
pre-existing condition of things.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> A new entity or a new
force was, as it were, inserted in the order of nature; a
new impulse was given to matter, or a new direction to
existing forces, and from that initial point a new series of
developments, which go on in accordance with law&mdash;a new
succession of births and growths&mdash;flows on as a part of
the grand totality of effects we call "nature." This is,
obviously, the Biblical conception. Here creation does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
not present itself as a necessary evolution from a first
matter or a first force in unbroken continuity, and without
any supernatural interposition. Here are clearly defined
creative epochs, new beginnings, which have their
origin in the creative will and word of God. What these
beginnings were is a question of the deepest interest.</p>

<p>A careful study of Gen. i. and ii. has led us to the
conclusion that there is something fundamental and radical
in the distinction between the creative words with
<i>bara</i> (בָרָא) and those with <i>yetsar</i> (יָצַר) and <i>aysah</i> (עָשָׂה).
It is, in reality, the distinction between Origination <i>de
novo</i> and Formation out of pre-existing materials. There
are three instances in which <i>bara</i> occurs in Gen. i. We
are fully convinced that in each case it denotes the origination
of a new entity&mdash;a real addition to the sum of existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Origination</span> (Gen. i. 1): "<i>In the beginning God
created</i> [אה = <i>the substance or essence of</i>] <i>the heavens
and the earth.</i>" This is the reading of Parkhurst's Hebrew
Grammar (1813), which has since that time been approved
by able lexicographers and commentators. Some
of these authorities have been already presented to the
reader.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> But even aside from philological considerations,
the context forbids us to regard <i>bara</i> here as denoting
"formation," for the product of that creative act
was "<i>formless</i> and <i>matter-less</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> that is, it was homogeneous,
non-differentiated, structureless, and destitute of
all sensible quality&mdash;an abyss of darkness and death, exhibiting
that sole condition of matter, "perhaps its only true
indication, namely, <i>inertia</i>."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The first created element
was the single omnipresent fluid <i>Ether</i>, out of which
all gross matter was built by the action of force. As we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
advance in this discussion we shall find that this is an
opinion which is entertained by the first physicists of the
age, as, for example, Thomson, Tait, Maxwell, Challis, in
England, and Norton and Hinrich in America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Origination</span> (Gen. i. 21): "<i>And God created
the great monsters, and every living soul</i> [נֶפֶשׁ הַיָּה = <i>soul
of life</i>] <i>that moveth.</i>"</p>

<p>The first created animals are here most carefully denoted
as "living souls," evidently to distinguish the life
now first manifested in nature from the molecular, "bioplasmic"
life which organizes the vegetable cell, and
builds up the tissues of the animal body. The life here
indicated has an <i>individuality</i> which separates it from
the universal life of nature. There is now an immaterial
entity&mdash;a soul, which is an individualized and indivisible
centre of force, a soul which has sensation, feeling, perception,
and memory, none of which are properties of
matter or products of organization. The animal soul is
not material, neither is it a function or phenomenon of
organized matter; it is a creation, and therefore <i>bara</i> is
here significantly employed to denote the origination of
something new; a new power or principle is here inserted
into the sphere of existing nature.</p>

<p>The second created entity is animal life&mdash;<i>Soul</i>&mdash;somatic
life as distinct and distinguishable from vegetable,
molecular, bioplasmic life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Origination</span> (Gen. i. 27): "<i>And God created man
in his own image, in the image of God created He him.</i>"</p>

<p>The entire paragraph (vers. 26-29) is obviously the record
of a supernatural origination. There is a significance
even in the change of the <i>creative</i> word. In regard to
prior and inferior existences the language is, "Let the
earth bring forth!" "Let the waters bring forth!" as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
though there were some parturient power in nature, or as
though nature co-operated with and furnished the conditions
and means of the Divine efficiency. But when man
is to be created the language is, "Let us make man;" thus
placing the origin of man outside the chain of physical
causation, and ascribing it to the immediate agency of
God. Besides, the creation here spoken of is the production
of a <i>spiritual</i>, not a material entity. "God created
man in <i>his own image</i>." This creation can not be a formation
out of a pre-existent matter, for no form of matter
can possibly bear any resemblance to God (Acts xvii. 29).
"God is <i>spirit</i>" and man can be like God only in so far
as he is endowed with a spiritual nature. Spirit alone can
bear the image of God. Whatever may be the teaching
of Genesis as to the origin of the human body, be it a formation
or a development, there is no uncertainty in its language
as to the origin of the human spirit. It is an inbreathing
from God. It proceeded directly from Him.
By no mere figure of speech, but by a Divine reality God
is "the Father of spirits," and man is the offspring and the
image of God. This likeness of God lifts man out of the
sphere of mere nature&mdash;it sets him apart in the essential
characteristics and endowments of his being as <i>above</i>
nature, and in some sense <i>divine</i>.</p>

<p>The third created entity is <i>Spirit</i>; spirit with its reason,
its liberty, its conscience, its susceptibility of Divine
inspiration, its capacity for endless progression in knowledge
and love.</p>

<p>Here, then, are three entities, <i>matter</i>, <i>life</i>, and <i>mind</i>
(= body, soul, and spirit), which had their beginning in an
act of absolute creation, and are therefore to be regarded
as primordial things.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Their existence is the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
condition of all subsequent formative and developing production,
inasmuch as all formation supposes a something
to be formed, and all evolution a something involved.
These primordial entities are the substratum, or ground, of
all the mediate architectonic creation which is effected by
the moving and informing presence and agency of the
Spirit of God.</p>

<p>This leads us to the consideration of those creative words
which are <i>formative</i>, and which always presuppose the existence
of real entities as the condition of their efficiency;
as, for example, "Let there be light;" "Let there be an expanse
in the midst of the waters;" "Let the dry land appear;"
"Let there be luminaries in the expanse of heaven."
All the dividings, the gatherings, the organizings, the ordainings,
and collocations suppose the prior existence of
matter.</p>

<p>We have seen that the first act of absolute creation&mdash;the
beginning of all beginnings&mdash;was the origination of
that mysterious entity which is the recipient of impulse, or
energy, and the physical substratum of all sensible phenomena.
From this initial point, the first <i>formative</i> act was
"the moving or brooding of the Spirit of God upon the
face of the abyss." All the qualities which matter presents
to the senses, all physical phenomena, are the result
of this action of the Deity upon matter&mdash;that is, <i>they are
all manifestations of force</i>.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> "By various motions of the
nature of eddies (vortices) the qualities of cohesion, elasticity,
hardness, weight, mass, or other universal properties
of matter, are given to small portions of the fluid [ether]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
which constitute the <i>chemical atoms</i>, and these by modifications
in their combination, form, and movement produce
all the accidental phenomena of <i>gross matter</i>; and
the primary fluid by other motions transmits light, radiant
heat, magnetism, and gravitation."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The first distinct creative formation was <i>molecular</i> and
<i>radiant energy</i>. "And God said, Let there be light."
By this "light" we are not to understand light in its technical
sense as distinguished from heat, but rather as including
heat, such light, in fact, as we meet with in nature
in the light of the sun, the same Hebrew word (אוֹר) being
used for both.</p>

<p>The second distinct creative formation was that wonderful
mechanical combination of chemical elements we call
the <i>atmosphere</i>. "And God said, Let there be an expanse
in the midst of the vapors, and let it be a division of
vapors from vapors." The Creator has endowed the oxygen
and nitrogen of the atmosphere with the power of retaining
the aeriform condition under all circumstances,
while the aqueous vapor is liable to very great fluctuation.
Were there no air surrounding the globe, the quantity of
vapor would adjust itself almost instantaneously to any
variation of temperature, and the maximum amount possible
would always be present at any given place; there
could then be no clouds and no genial showers of diffusive
rain. "An elevation of temperature would be attended
by rapid evaporation, and the amount of water required to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
fill the space would suddenly flash into vapor; while, on
the other hand, a corresponding depression of temperature
would be accompanied by an equally sudden precipitation
of the aqueous vapor, not in genial showers, but terrific torrents....
The drops, falling without resistance, would be
as destructive in their effects as volleys of leaden shot."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
The presence of a dense medium, such as the atmosphere,
retards these sudden changes, and determines the formation
of clouds. Thus "the expanse" is admirably adapted
to the creative purposes of "<i>dividing</i> the waters from the
waters."</p>

<p>The third creative formation was the <i>chemical compounds</i>
and their molar aggregation in land and seas.
"And God said, Let the waters below the expanse be gathered
together unto one place, and let the dry ground appear."
The chemical reactions, crystallizations, precipitations,
and sedimentary accumulations involved in the creative
formation are admirably sketched in Ch. VI. of Dr.
Winchell's "Sketches of Creation." The transmutation of
the primary fluid into gross matter was something more
than a natural evolution&mdash;it was a "<i>creative</i> action,"<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and
the exact numerical proportions in which the chemical
elements combine must be the result of a distinct creative
impulse.</p>

<p>The fourth creative formation was <i>bioplasm</i>, or that
vitalized germinal matter which is instrumental in building
up the tissues and organs of plants (and animals).
"And God said, Let the land sprout forth sprouts; herbs
seeding seed, fruit-trees producing fruit after their kind
wherein is their seed." The vital force which is concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ed
in the formation of bioplasm (vitalized matter) must be
regarded as distinct, on the one hand, from the physical
forces which are efficient in the combinations and aggregations
of non-living matter,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and, on the other hand, from
that sentient, percipient, self-moving principle which constitutes
the animal soul. "The 'life' of a man or an animal
is very different from what is termed the 'life' of a
white blood, or a mucus, or a pus corpuscle; inasmuch as
many hundreds of white blood corpuscles, or elemental
units of the tissues, might die in man without affecting the
'life' of the man; moreover the man himself might perish,
and some of the corpuscles remain alive.... By the
<i>life</i> of a man (or an animal) something very different is
meant from what we understand by the life of each elemental
unit of the organism, <i>and the difference is not
merely of degree but of kind</i>."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Bioplasm, or cell-life, is
generic; soul-life is specific, individual, and indivisible.
The former we regard as the direct effect of the Divine
life, immanent in nature; the latter is an individualized
centre of force, "a delegation of Divine power under limits
of necessity." The physical forces are the action of
God <i>upon</i> matter, the vital force is the immanence of God
<i>in</i> matter. The first is mechanical, the second is vito-dynamical.</p>

<p>The fifth creative formation was the adjustment of the
cosmical relations of the heavenly bodies, and the establishment
of such atmospheric conditions as rendered the sun
and moon the <i>luminaries</i>, or light-bearers, to the earth.
"And God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of
heaven to divide the day and night." What these adjustments
and collocations were, we are not able to say. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
ultimate cause of the sun's luminosity is yet an unsolved
problem. No explanation thus far offered has been accepted
as adequate by the majority of scientific men. The
statement of Genesis, which ascribes "the appointment of
the sun and moon to be light-bearers to the earth" to a distinct
creative formation of some kind, is not, therefore, invalidated
by science.</p>

<p>The sixth creative formation was the <i>material organisms</i>
of the varied species of "living souls" which people the
<i>waters</i>; the seventh, of those which people the <i>air</i>; the
eighth, of those which people the <i>land</i>. The final creative
formation was the body of man, into which God breathed
the breath of <i>lives</i>, and in consequence of which he became
not merely a living soul, but a spiritual personality,
a <i>spirit-being</i>.</p>

<p>The question whether the material organisms in which
the varied species of "living souls" are embodied were
each the product of a special creation, or whether later and
higher organisms were derived from prior and lower organisms
by "filiation," so that "new species are new births,"
is of little consequence to the interpretation of Genesis.
The essential element of species is a <i>spiritual</i> entity.
Specific existence is a positive existence, an immaterial
existence,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> "a soul of life." "It is not," says Dr. Winchell,
"a primordial organic form: <i>it is the life embodied within
that form</i>&mdash;the principle which rules its existence, moulds
its features, determines its instincts, and conserves its specific
and individual identity. It is the principle embodied
in the ovum&mdash;often a mere microscopic organism&mdash;which
unfailingly holds fast to the specific type, and through all
embryonic and immature existence guides the progress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
development in one direction, toward one end. Here is
more than matter: here is a power which controls matter,
controls chemistry&mdash;manifests its superiority to body, and
asserts its dignity as spirit." The establishment of a genetic
connection from the lowest to the highest material
organism would not decide the question as to "the origin
of species." The origin of species lies back of all material
organisms. The species is a "spiritual germ," which acts
upon and fashions the material elements, and through them
expresses its own characteristics. That therefore which
constitutes man a distinct species is not to be sought in
anatomical peculiarities, but in spiritual attributes. It is
the image of God and the inspiration of God which lifts
man out of mere animal nature and makes him a <i>peculiar
species</i>&mdash;"one genus, and that genus the only one of the
order."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Nor would this title be affected by any theory
about the mode of the creation of his body. There would
be nothing more derogatory to Omnipotence, or even to
human nature, in the conjecture that man did not become
"a living personal spirit" until he had passed through various
stages of animal life, than in the doctrine that he
was fashioned immediately out of the dust of the earth.
There is as much dignity, or, if the reader please, as much
humility of origin in the one case as in the other. The
former is an extraordinary birth, consequent on some mysterious
action of the Deity on the course of nature; the
latter is a miraculous formation. The Hebrew text is as
favorable to the one hypothesis as to the other. The preposition
"of," or "out of," is not authorized by the original.
Dr. Whedon reads the whole passage as follows: "And
God developed [וַיִּיצֶר] the man&mdash;dust of the earth&mdash;and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives, and the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
became to a living person."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> If the body of the second
Adam, the Divine Man, was a birth (a miraculous birth),
we do not see that any one need be shocked at the suggestion
that the body of the first Adam was also an extraordinary
or supernatural birth. Science may have free
scope to settle the problem on purely inductive grounds.</p>

<p>The following scheme will exhibit our conception of the
cumulative character of the creative development:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 549px;">
<img src="images/167b.png" width="549" height="477" alt="" />
</div>

<p>3. <i>Creation was consecutive.</i> The creative epochs follow
each other in a manifest Order of Thought. The
reasons for this order are obvious on the face of the sacred
narrative, so that we are constrained to regard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
creative process as the realization of a purpose, the development
of a foreseen and predetermined plan.</p>

<p>This is clearly manifest from the aptly styled "pauses
of contemplation" which occur in the progress of the sacred
narrative. At each stage of the creative work the
Deity is represented as surveying that already finished,
and pronouncing it "<i>good</i>" (טוֹב = καλόν, fair and good).
This may seem strange when viewed apart from the completed
plan. What good, one might ask, is the light when
there is no eye to see? What good the expanse of heaven,
the land and seas, with none to inhabit them? What
good the plants with none to use them? But the Intelligence
that foresaw the end toward which the creative
process was tending could recognize the fitness and the
beauty of each new element of creation as contributing
to that completed whole, which, when realized, is pronounced
"<i>very good</i>." Thus each stage of the advancing
work of creation is pronounced "good" in view of its
subordination to the ultimate purpose, which is the highest
"good." Each is a step upward and onward, and is
"good" as a preparation and a means for a better that
is yet to come. Thus the reading of the sacred Hymn of
Creation leaves the decided impression that a chain of
subordination and interdependence runs through the
entire organic and inorganic creation, binding the whole
together in an ideal unity. All the laws and results of
the past are brought forward, and become a prelude and
a preparation for the future developments. The earlier
stages of the creation furnish the conditions for the later
stages, and are in some sense a prophecy of what is to
come. The successive stages of creation are thus results,
in part, of a "nature"&mdash;a constitution and order of things
already established, and in part of a new impulse carrying
nature forward toward the predestinated goal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The more extended our acquaintance with the actual
economy of nature, the more does the subordination and
interdependence of the creative epochs become manifest,
and the more are we convinced that "the law of consecution"
which reveals itself in the sacred narrative is a real
law of the universe.</p>

<p>The existence of radiant energy (heat and light), is the
fundamental precondition of all the subsequent creative
formations. It is more universal than gravitation, and
absolutely co-extensive with the universe,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the connecting
bond between all worlds. It determines the temperature
of space, of the atmosphere, and of the earth, and,
in fact, most of the phenomena of meteorology. It is essential
to the life and growth of the plant, and ultimately
of the animal; without it, indeed, no life could exist upon
the earth. Next in importance is the atmosphere, which
has peculiar relations to light and heat. It softens the
intensity of light, and diffuses it in every direction; it absorbs
and retains heat, and, infolding the earth as with a
mantle, keeps it warm. It conditions the formation of
clouds, and determines the fall of genial showers. It is
the medium in which combustion and change, and all the
phenomena of life, take place. Its oxygen has been the
chief world-builder, and its nitrogen has been aptly styled
the <i>zoögen</i> or generator of life. The gathering of the
waters into lakes and seas, the phenomena of aqueous circulation,
the formation of soils through its agency&mdash;these
were all preconditions of vegetable life. "Reasoning
deductively, it is equally presumable that vegetable life
preceded animal life in order of appearance.... Vegetation
is capable of drawing its sustenance from the mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
world, while animals rely exclusively upon organic food.
The vegetable stands between the animal and the mineral,
performing a sort of commissary function in behalf of the
animal. The animal&mdash;even the carnivorous animal&mdash;implies
the vegetable. All things considered, we are led to
believe that plant life had a history upon our earth a
full epoch before the existence of animals."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Finally,
all geological preparations and ideas converge in man.
"The beneficent provisions of the earth's crust not only
prophesy man, but they reach their finality in man. It
was only for human uses that the coal was treasured in
the recesses of the earth; for human uses alone the
mountains have lifted up their burdens of iron; for human
uses only the grandest movements of geological history
elaborated and distributed the soils. It is only for
man that the forests yield their abundant supplies of timber
and fuel. For man the edible and medicinal vegetables
were provided. For man the natures of the domestic
animals were moulded, and their domestic attachments
are directed to no other being."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Thus through the long
ages of geological time the earth was preparing for the
dwelling-place of man, and in the earliest forms of animal
life his coming was prefigured and foretold.</p>

<p>4. <i>The completed creation is a Divine harmony.</i> This
is the abiding impression which the sublime Psalm of Creation
leaves upon our minds as we close the book. It has
taught us this final lesson, that the universe is the manifestation
of <i>one grand creative thought</i>, as comprehensive in
the diversity of its parts as it is complete in the unity of
its plan. We learn, not merely that God made all the parts
of the universe, but that He made each part for a specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
purpose, and that all the separate and successive parts are
chords in nature's music, parts of creation's anthem of
perpetual praise. The Symbolical Hymn of Creation,
with its striking parallelisms, its balance and correlation
of parts, its harmonic numbers (3 and 7 and 10, the symbols
of perfection), its pauses and refrains, its rhythm and
unity symbolizes the universal prevalence of <i>Law</i> in nature;
reveals a changeless <i>Order</i> in respect to space and time, to
number and form; suggests harmonious <i>relations</i> between
terrestrial conditions and cosmical adjustments, between
organic and inorganic existence, and accords with the wonderful
rhythm which pervades the Cosmos.</p>

<p>The glorious mansion is first built, then furnished. A
triad of days is devoted to its architecture, a triad to its
occupants. The former describes a series of <i>dividings</i>
and <i>combinings</i>, the latter portrays a series of <i>formations</i>
and <i>vivifications</i>. "The last day of each era includes
one work typical of the era, and another related to it in
essential points, but also prophetic of the future. Vegetation,
while, for physical reasons, a part of the creation of
the third day, was also prophetic of the future Organic
era, in which the progress of life was the grand characteristic.
The record thus accords with the fundamental
principle in history that the characteristic of an age has
its beginnings within the age preceding. So, again, man,
while like other mammals in structure, even to the homologies
of every bone and muscle, was endowed with a spiritual
nature which looked forward to another era, that of
spiritual existence. The seventh "day," the day of rest
from the work of creation, is man's period of preparation
for that new existence, and it is to promote this special
end that, in strict parallelism, the Sabbath follows man's
six days of work."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p><i>The Principle of Teleology not affected by the Theory of Evolution.</i>&mdash;"It
is necessary to remark that there is a wider teleology which is not touched
by the doctrine of evolution, but is actually based upon the fundamental proposition
of evolution.... The teleological and the mechanical views of nature
are not necessarily mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the more purely
a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly does he assume a primordial
molecular arrangement, of which all the phenomena of the universe are the
consequences; and the more completely thereby is he at the mercy of the
teleologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this primordial molecular
arrangement was not <i>intended</i> to evolve the phenomena of the universe."&mdash;Prof.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br/>
CONSERVATION.&mdash;THE RELATION OF GOD TO THE WORLD.</h2>

<p>"The relations which unite the creature and the Creator compose a problem
obscure and delicate, the two extreme solutions of which are equally false
and perilous: on the one hand, a God so passes into the world that He seems
to be absorbed in it; on the other hand, a God so separated from the world,
that the world has the appearance of going on without Him; on both sides
there is equal excess, equal danger, equal error."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cousin.</span></p>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have endeavored to present
the Christian doctrine concerning God, and concerning
the world as the work of God. God is a <i>person</i>&mdash;the
unconditioned Personality, all of whose determinations
are from Himself. And creation is the voluntary act of
God, who freely chooses to award existence to other beings
distinct from Himself. If our scientific conceptions
are in harmony with this doctrine, we are safe from the
temptations of materialism on the one hand, and proof
against the seductions of pantheism on the other. Henceforth
we must regard the unconditioned Being as essentially
distinct from the material universe. Matter with
its phenomena is limited in extent and duration, God is
infinite and eternal. Extension is not an attribute of the
Divine substance. Succession is not a mode of God's
eternity. The Divine life infinitely transcends the dynamical
life of the universe.</p>

<p>Still there is some connection, some relation between
God and the world. Of this we have the fullest assurance,
however incapable we may be of comprehending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
mode. The material universe is the product of the Divine
efficiency, and therefore the first and most fundamental
relation of God to the world is that of <i>causality</i>.
The universe exists solely through the will of God. It
had a beginning, and the beginning of the world was the
beginning of time. Prior to that beginning there was no
succession, no limitation, no finite existence; only the
eternal and infinite One. The creative efficiency was put
forth, and matter, as the statical condition necessary to
the manifestation of physical phenomena, began to be.
The Spirit of God moved upon the formless abyss, and
phenomenal change commenced its history. With motion
and consequent succession there arose the relations
of time. With the differentiation and collocation of matter
there arose the relations of space. And the wealth
and fullness of inorganic and organic nature sprang up
under the directive, formative, and vitalizing energy of
the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>But is there no further relation of God to the world,
beyond that which is involved in the primary and solitary
fact of creative causality? Did the connection of God
with his works terminate in an event which belongs to
the inapproachable past? Did the Creator, in the beginning,
give self-being to the substance of the universe, and
endow it with active forces, so that it can exist and act
apart from and independent of God? Have the laws of
nature a real efficiency, so that the further agency of God
is dispensed with, and the universe can pursue a fixed and
inevitable path of self-development without his control
and oversight? Or is God still immanent in nature, upholding
all substance, the power of all force, the life of
all life, shaping all forms, and organizing all systems?
In a word, has the Divine efficiency remained, since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
first creative act, in sublime repose, or does "the Father
work hitherto," sustaining, moving, vitalizing, and perfecting
the universe&mdash;the <i>Conservator</i>, as well as the Creator,
of all things? This is the living question of our times,
whether viewed from the scientific or the theological stand-point.
The mental posture we assume in relation to this
question must determine our systems of philosophy and
religion.</p>

<p>The language of Scripture on this point is direct and
explicit, and unless our interpretation thereof needs to be
modified in order to place it in harmony with the general
spirit and tenor of Christian teaching, or with the unquestionable
facts of nature, which are also a revelation of
God, there can be no difficulty in determining the Christian
doctrine of God's relation to the world. It teaches
us, not only that all things were made by God, but that
all things are <i>sustained</i> by God. God is still the first and
immediate cause of all existence. "He giveth to all life,
and breath, and all things" (Acts xvii. 25). The created
universe is in complete and ceaseless dependence on the
Divine causality; it consists by the same will and the
same word by which it was first originated. He who
made all things, continues to "uphold all things by the
word of his power" (Heb. i. 3). "He is before all things,
and by Him all things consist" (Col. i. 17). The universe
is not self-existent, nor self-evolved, neither has it
any inherent power of self-perpetuation. Notwithstanding
the individuality and self-life conceded to the creature,
it has no independent existence apart from God,
"for of Him, and through Him, and for Him are all
things, to whom be glory forever." (Rom. xi. 36.)</p>

<p>The recognition of a real presence of God in nature,
and of the immediate agency of God in the production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of all natural phenomena, has been a characteristic of the
religious consciousness in all ages. This consciousness of
the presence of God embracing and sustaining all worldly
being is, in fact, an essential content of all vital piety.
"It is only a mechanical deism, a barren rationalistic theology,
or a piety meagre in the last degree, which has interposed
a chasm between God and his creatures." The
religious spirit is remarkably developed in the Psalms of
David, and here all the operations of nature are spoken
of as the operations of Deity. The thunder is "the voice
of God." The lightnings are "his arrows." The earthquakes
and volcanoes are produced directly by Him.
"He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth
the hills, and they smoke." "He giveth snow like wool,
He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes, He casteth forth his
ice like morsels; who can stand before his cold? He
causeth his winds to blow, and the waters flow." "He
covereth the heavens with clouds, He prepareth rain for
the earth." "He watereth the hills from his chambers,
the earth is satisfied with the fruit of his work." "He
causeth grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service
of man." "He giveth to the beast his food, and to
the young ravens which cry." "All creatures wait upon
Him, and He giveth them their meat in due season. He
openeth his hand, they are filled with good. He hideth
his face, and they are troubled. He taketh away their
breath, they die and return to the dust. <i>He sendeth forth
his Spirit, and they are created</i>; and He reneweth the
face of the earth." To the eye of the inspired writer, the
agency of God is concerned in every process and every
product of nature. "There are diversities of operations,
but <i>it is the same God who worketh all in all</i>." His will
and his power are the only real forces in nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The interpretation which the Church has given of this
teaching of the Sacred Scriptures has been remarkably
uniform through the ages. She has always taught that
the continuance of the world, no less than its origination,
has its ground in the Divine causality; and every theory
of the relation of God to the world which has sacrificed
the doctrine of the all-embracing, all-sustaining presence
of God in the universe, as an immediate and real efficiency,
has always been rejected as Pelagian, Rationalistic, or
Deistic. The conception of the Divine conservation of
the world as the simple, uniform, and universal agency of
God sustaining all created substances and powers in every
moment of their existence and activity, is the catholic doctrine
of Christendom. In attempting the difficult, perhaps
impossible task of conceiving the <i>mode</i> of this Divine conservation,
different theories have been developed. But
whatever the conception formed, whether that of the Divine
<i>co-operation</i> (<i>concursus Dei generalis</i>), as taught by
St. Augustine and the Schoolmen; or that of a Divine intermediate
<i>impulse</i> (<i>impulsus non cogens</i>), as taught by
Luther; or that of the Divine <i>sustentation</i> (<i>sustentatio
Dei</i>), as held by the Arminians; or even that of the <i>superintendence</i>
and <i>control</i> of the Deity, as adopted by some
modern religious scientists,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> they all repose on the ulti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>mate
truth that whatever is created can have no necessary
or independent existence; the same power which called
it into being must continue to uphold it in being; and
were God to withdraw his conserving efficiency the creature
would be immediately annihilated.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>St. Augustine, "the father of systematic theology," conceived
the Divine conservation of the world as a <i>continual
creation</i> (<i>creatio continua</i>). He taught that the life
and activity of the creatures, collectively and individually,
are ceaselessly and absolutely dependent on and conditioned
by the almighty and omnipresent agency of God.
"Were He to withdraw from the world his creative power,
it would straightway lapse into nothingness."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Thomas
Aquinas, "the Angelical Doctor," who is regarded as
having brought Scholastic theology to its highest development,
held the same views on this subject as Augustine.
He taught that "preservation is an ever-renewed creation."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
All creaturely causes derive their efficiency directly
and continually from the First Cause.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Theological writers of more recent times have assented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to these views with notable uniformity. Dr. Samuel
Clarke, the intimate friend of Newton, whose "Lectures
on the Being and Attributes of God," and on the "Evidences
of Natural and Revealed Religion," secured for
him a European renown as a Christian philosopher, states
the doctrine of the immediate agency of the Deity with
remarkable explicitness. "All things that are done in
the world are done either immediately by God Himself,
or by created intelligent beings. Matter being evidently
not capable of any laws or powers whatsoever, any more
than it is capable of intelligence, except only this one
negative power, that every part of it will of itself always
and necessarily continue in that state, whether of rest or
motion, wherein it at present is. So that all those things
which we commonly say are the effects of the natural
powers of matter and laws of motion, of gravitation, attraction,
or the like, are indeed (if we will speak strictly
and properly) <i>the effect of God's acting upon matter continually
and every moment</i>, either immediately by Himself,
or mediately by some created intelligent beings....
Consequently there is no such thing as what we commonly
call the <i>course of nature</i>, or the <i>power of nature</i>.
The course of nature, truly and properly speaking, is
nothing else but the will of God, producing certain effects
in a continued, regular, constant, and uniform manner."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Clarke may properly be regarded as the representative
of the metaphysico-theological thought of the seventeenth
century. No apology is needed at this hour for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
presenting John Wesley as the best representative of the
evangelical movement of the eighteenth century which
adhered firmly to the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the sacred
writers. He expresses the evangelical conception with
admirable clearness and force: "God is also the supporter
of all the things which He has made. He beareth,
upholdeth, sustaineth all created things by the word of
his power; by the same powerful word which brought
them out of nothing. As this was absolutely necessary
for the beginning of their existence, it is equally so for
the continuance of it; were his almighty influence withdrawn,
they could not subsist a moment longer.... He
preserves them in their several relations, connections, and
dependencies, so as to compose one system of beings, to
form one entire universe, according to the counsel of his
will.... He is the true author of all the motion in the
universe. All matter of whatever kind is absolutely and
totally <i>inert</i>. It does not, can not in any case move itself....
Neither the sun, moon, nor stars move themselves.
<i>They are moved every moment by the Almighty hand
that made them.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> These views are earnestly maintained
by Nitzsch and Müller, Chalmers and Harris, Young and
Whedon, Channing and Martineau.</p>

<p>The religious life of the present age, in all its purest
and most vigorous manifestations, still clings with passionate
ardor to the belief that God is every where present,
and that the ceaseless, uniform, and direct agency of God
is still upholding, moving, vivifying, and controlling all
things. The harp of David is restrung and swept with a
firmer hand. It rings with nobler conceptions, and swells
into diviner harmonies. God is recognized as "<i>above</i> all,
<i>through</i> all, and <i>in</i> all." "In Him we live and move,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and have our being." The Christian still believes, with a
fuller and richer assurance, that God's presence&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He still hears the voice of God in the thunder at midnight,
and in the rustling of the forest leaves at noonday.
He sees the beauty of God in "the silent faces of the
clouds," and in the virgin blush of the solitary flower. He
sees the life of God in the activities of organic nature,
and marks his power and presence in the falling rain
and noiseless dew, the flowing river and the restless ocean.
The seasons, as they come round to him in their grateful
vicissitudes, bring to him fresh tokens of the goodness of
God, and inspire him with perennial joy.</p>

<p>A discussion of the Christian doctrine of the relation
of God to the world can scarcely be regarded as adequate
and complete which keeps not constantly in view the theories
of certain "advanced thinkers" that conflict with
the views here presented. We do not now refer to the
extreme opinions of the Atheists, who deny the existence
of God, proclaim the eternity of matter, and regard force
as an inherent and essential attribute of matter, by which
all the phenomena of nature and humanity are necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
evolved; nor of the Pantheists, on the other hand, who
deny the personality of God, and represent the Deity as
an eternal <i>natura naturans</i>, which by a spontaneous and
unconscious development is forever emerging as the <i>natura
naturata</i>. For these thinkers there can be no conceivable
Providence. "Science has shown us that we are
under the dominion of general laws, and that there is no
special Providence. Nature acts with fearful uniformity;
stern as fate, absolute as a tyrant, merciless as death; too
vast to praise; too inexplicable to worship; too inexorable
to propitiate; it has no ear for prayer, no heart for
sympathy, no arm to save."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>At present we are to deal with the theories of a class
of scientists who believe in the existence of God&mdash;of a
personal God, and who profess the greatest reverence for
the Sacred Scriptures, but whose God is clearly not the
God the Bible reveals. This general class of thinkers
may be subdivided into subordinate schools, as they verge
toward one or the other of the extremes above indicated.</p>

<p>1. One school is represented by such writers as Prof.
Tyndall, Dr. H. Bence Jones, and Dr. Bastian. Their fundamental
principle is "the absolute inseparability of matter
and force;" consequently they do not recognize the
Divine Will as the sole and immediate cause of the motion
and life of the universe. Molecular attractions and
repulsions are the primal forces communicated to matter
at the Creation, and from "the self-activity of these primary
forces" result all the forms of energy in nature,
whether organic or inorganic. "Our idea of the grandeur,
the unity, and the power of the first cause," writes
Dr. H. Bence Jones, "will surely not be lessened if we
can show that one law of the union of matter and force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and of the conservation of energy obtains throughout the
organic as well as the inorganic creation."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Here we
have a close approximation, if not intentionally, yet logically,
to the Atheistic extreme. The transition seems easy,
if not inevitable, to the recognition of force as an inherent
and necessary attribute of matter which <i>may</i> be eternal.
Then what need of a God, or what place for one, if
the forces and laws of matter are adequate to the explanation
of all phenomena? As Martineau aptly suggests,
"These properties and powers once installed in the cosmic
executive are too apt, like mayors of the palace, to
set up for themselves," and eject the real Lord and God.</p>

<p>2. Another school is represented by such men as Professors
Owen, Huxley, and Baden Powell, who deny the ultimate
distinction between matter and force, and regard
both as phenomenal manifestations of some "unknown
substratum"&mdash;a supramaterial <span class="smcap">PHYSIS</span> (φύσις) which is
identical with the Divine substance, the <i>natura naturans</i>
of Spinoza. To these minds the universe discloses nothing
but immutable law, absolute continuity, and necessary
development. "The grand principle of the <i>self-evolving
powers of nature</i>"<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and "the grand inductive conclusion
of universal and <i>eternal</i> order,"<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> are the bases of all rational
theology. Here we encounter a phase of thought
which verges toward the extreme of Pantheism. The
Deity himself is conditioned in his action by the eternal
and immutable laws of nature, and can not be conceived
as a living Will exercising control over and subordinating
these laws to higher moral ideas and ends. This doc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>trine,
Prof. Powell admits, "summarily overrides the Mosaic
creation, renders miracles irrational, excludes a special
providence, and, we may add, dismisses prayer as a useless
absurdity."</p>

<p>3. A third and intermediate school assumes the existence
of a plastic nature (<i>vis formativa</i>) intermediate between
the Creator and his work, by which the phenomena
of nature are produced. This hypothesis was propounded
by Cudworth, and has lately been reproduced by Dr. Laycock
and Mr. Murphy under the name of "unconscious
organizing intelligence," to explain those facts of organic
nature which come under the relation of means and ends,
or structure and function. This hypothesis must deflect
toward one or other of the extremes indicated, when it attempts
to decide in what subject this "unconscious intelligence"
inheres. If it be said that it inheres in matter,
the tendency must be toward Atheism: that it inheres
in spirit, then the tendency is toward Pantheism.</p>

<p>Common to all these hypotheses is the denial of the direct,
immediate, and voluntary agency of God in nature
as <i>the only real and efficient force</i>. They are all attempts
to account for the conservation of the world by "the conservation
and transformation of energy," that is, by secondary
causes, which in reality are only conditions and not
real causes. They interpose a chasm between God and
the world. The universe is a self-supporting, self-evolving
machine, and God is an isolated, incommunicable abstraction.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that certain Christian writers have
deemed it necessary, on what they consider moral grounds,
to give countenance to theories which in one form or another
ascribe a real efficiency to natural laws, and dispense
with the immediate and ceaseless agency of God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the conservation of the world. They imagine that some
such hypothesis is needed to vindicate the Divine honor
and righteousness. In their imagination, it derogates
from the Divine majesty to be ceaselessly concerned and
busied with the minute and insignificant operations of
nature, or even cognizant of them. His eternal serenity
would be disturbed, and his unsullied purity compromised
by any connection therewith, and He would become
responsible for the disorders and abnormities, the
evils and sufferings, which appear in the world. He must,
therefore, be released from a constant and direct connection
with the universe. He must leave nature to the necessary
predestinated course of self-evolution, or, if He interpose
at all, it must be in some exceptional, extraordinary,
and supernatural way; so that, if there be a providential
administration, every act and incident thereof
must be a <i>miracle</i>.</p>

<p>We respect the motives, but we can not approve the procedure
or commend the logic of these theologians. The
moral difficulties they would by these hypotheses evade
still remain in all their force. "Any hypothesis which
essays to relieve these difficulties from pressing against
Providence only transfers and leaves them to press with
equal force against an original creation."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The Supreme
Intelligence which originally endowed matter with its
properties, and ordained the laws of force, must have foreseen
all possible combinations, interactions, and consequences,
and, if it be proper to speak of responsibilities in
this connection, must be as responsible for these consequences
as though they were the direct effect of immediate
volition. An agent is accountable not only for his
acts, but for all the foreseen consequences of his acts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
The solution of these difficulties must be sought in another
field.</p>

<p>Meantime it may be observed that these theologians affect
a concern for the Divine honor which even revelation
itself does not confess. It teaches that all the operations
of nature are the operations of God, and no apologies are
offered for consequences which, to short-sighted men, may
appear to conflict with righteousness or love. Does the
earthquake tear the mountain asunder, and spread devastation
and death throughout the surrounding country? it
is the Lord who roareth from Zion, and uttereth his voice
from Jerusalem; He causeth the habitation of the shepherds
to mourn, and the top of Carmel to wither.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The
people bow their heads with reverence, and in their chastening
sorrows see the hand of God. But these philosophic
theologians must correct the language of Scripture,
and tone it down in harmony with the capricious demands
of modern scientists. The language of the ancient Prophet
of God is simply the expression of a childlike and subjective
conception of nature which modern science has emptied
of all its significance. The earthquake was the product
of "secondary causes"&mdash;of inherent nature-forces
which now exist and act independent of the agency and
control of God. To maintain the consistency of their hypothesis,
they will even affirm that the catastrophe was unforeseen,
and did not come within the purview of the creative
plan. The exuberance of the Oriental imagination
has thrown a haze of unreality over all the descriptions of
natural phenomena, and therefore the language of the inspired
Psalmist must be amended. When he tells us that
God "covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth
rain for the earth," we must paraphrase after the follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ing
fashion: "In the beginning God gave to water those
properties, and determined those cosmical conditions which,
when coincident, result in the formation of clouds and the
descent of rain!" This, we are told, is the interpretation
which modern science demands. Conservation is simply
"the indestructibility of matter and the persistence of
force," and Providence is "the uniformity of natural law."
We must no longer believe that God is a present, immanent,
and diffusive Power and Life in nature. To find the
connection between God and nature we must remount by
a process of regressive thought to the first, and, indeed, the
last act of creation&mdash;the primal origination of matter and
motion. So that if now piety would stand face to face with
its supreme object, it is compelled to fling itself back into
the abyss of duration, before the mountains were brought
forth, or ever the earth and the world were formed.</p>

<p>Practically, this conception gives us a universe without
a God; for the world, once created, and stocked with the
necessary forces and adjustments and laws, will henceforth
govern itself. It will run its predestinated course in
obedience to an original impulse, and realize a perpetual
motion without further oversight or care or control. The
world is a huge soulless machine, and theology is reduced
to Mechanical Deism! But surely no one pretends that
this theory satisfies the demands of Scripture language,
and fills up the complement of its idea. Practically, it
renders the Word of God of no effect.</p>

<p>This theory is equally inadequate to satisfy the cravings
of the human heart. "The heart demands a present
God&mdash;a God who is never far from any one of us; it demands
the immediate presence and constant care of a
heavenly Father; it demands, when it looks upon nature,
to feel that God is there, not in his laws only, but in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>scious
and perpetual action; not in the sense of a Wisdom
and Goodness, embodied in arrangements contrived
and perfected long ago, as the mind of an artificer may
be said to be present in the work of his hands, but in the
sense of a Love co-present to every aspect of nature, and
a Will inworking in every event that takes place."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> "Reacting
against the usurpation of secondary causation,
wearied of its distance from the Fountain-head, it flings
itself back with pathetic repentance into the arms of the
Primary Infinitude."</p>

<p>The relation of God to the world, however, is a problem
which can not be solved by an appeal to sentiment.
The religious consciousness may be the counter-proof, but
it can not be the starting-point of a philosophy which aims
at the explanation of things&mdash;that is, of their origin and
continuance&mdash;by principles and ideas of the reason. For
what is meant by <i>understanding</i>, but translation into ideas,
and comprehending under necessary principles? Any
theory which essays such explanation of things must therefore
commend itself to the logical understanding, and be
capable of logical construction.</p>

<p>Now the various hypotheses which seek to dispense
with the immediate agency of God, and to explain the
conservation of the world by "secondary" or natural
agencies, when critically examined do not satisfy the understanding.
However convenient for the evasion of difficulties,
however plausible for their simplicity and manageable
clearness, on a closer inspection they are found to
be inadequate.</p>

<p>1. <i>There is the hypothesis of natural law.</i> The world
is governed by general laws which are fixed and immutable.
These laws were impressed upon matter at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
beginning, and in obedience to them the universe has
gradually evolved itself in rigid continuity and necessary
order. No room, therefore, is left for special direction
or providential control, and if the term "providence" is
at all permissible, it is only as a synonym for natural law.</p>

<p>It is affirmed by the advocates of this hypothesis that
"the grand principle of the uniformity and constancy of
natural causes is <i>a primary law of belief</i> so strongly entertained
by the truly inductive inquirer that he can not
conceive the <i>possibility</i> of its failure."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> As science extends
her domain and pushes her discoveries into new regions,
cases that once seemed anomalous are found to be
conformable to this general rule, and therefore we are justified
in assuming the absolute uniformity and inviolability
of natural law through all the realms of time and
space. Thus we reach "the grand inductive conclusion
of the universal and <i>eternal</i> order of nature." But an
<i>overruling</i> providence must step beyond <i>ordinary rule</i>:
it must control, interrupt, modify, or in some manner give
a new direction to the action of nature, and thus become
<i>super</i>natural&mdash;that is, miraculous. So that were we even
to concede the phenomenal reality of the miracles recorded
in the New Testament, and to accept them as "objects
of faith, but not as the evidences of faith," still modern
science would forbid us to believe that any supernatural
interposition can <i>now</i> take place. Not a single instance
of counteraction or control of natural law can now
be authenticated, and therefore we must regard special
providence as incredible and impossible.</p>

<p>The first error, and indeed the fundamental error, of
this hypothesis is the assumption that the absolute uniformity
and permanence of nature is "<i>a primary law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
belief</i>," and therefore the natural philosopher "must set
out with clear ideas of the <i>possible</i> and the <i>impossible</i>."</p>

<p>Now we grant that had we such <i>à priori</i> conviction of
the permanence and immutability of nature, then it would
be impossible to prove that the order of nature had a beginning,
or that there could be any interference with the
agencies or laws of nature by a supernatural power. "No
evidence adduced in favor of a creation or of Divine interposition
could ever be so strong as to overcome the
necessary belief in direct opposition to it."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> But the
truth is, we have no such intuitive conviction. Our belief
has none of the characteristics of an <i>à priori</i> intuition:
it is neither self-evident nor universal nor necessary.
John Stuart Mill has successfully shown that this belief
is the result of experience, that it is entertained only
by the cultivated and educated few, and that even among
such it has been of slow growth. Therefore he properly
concludes that "the uniformity in the succession of events ...
must be received, <i>not as the law of the universe, but
of that portion only which is within the range of our
means of observation</i>, with a reasonable degree of extension
to adjacent cases."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Belief in the uniformity of nature is an induction from
<i>experience</i>, and not a primary intuition. And by the
word experience, in this connection, we must understand
not the experience of one man only, or of one generation,
but the accumulated experience of mankind in all ages
as registered in books or transmitted by tradition. But
how limited, at best, is human experience&mdash;how circumscribed
both in time and space! Compared with the vastness
and duration of the universe, it is narrowed down to
a mere point. All experience, be it that of the individ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>ual
or of mankind, is only finite. To infer a universal
law from a limited number of instances is to violate to
the uttermost the fundamental canon of logic that "no
conclusion must contain more than was contained in the
premises from which it is drawn."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Inductive science
can only give us the contingent and the relative, it can
never attain to the necessary and the absolute. By abstraction,
comparison, and generalization it may furnish
us with <i>general</i> notions, but it can not give us <i>universal</i>
principles. "Experience can not conduct us to universal
and necessary truths&mdash;not to universal, because she has
not tried all cases; not to necessary, because necessity is
not a matter to which experience can testify."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The intuitive
reason, we doubt not, is furnished with necessary
and universal principles which may illuminate the pathway
of experience, and give meaning and law to the facts
of sensation, so that man may become "the Interpreter of
Nature;" but certainly the absolute uniformity of nature
is not one of these ideas.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the boasted mathematical precision of
the inductive method, and the rigid exactness of its results,
scientific men are not wholly exempt from the common
infirmity of hasty generalization. They are perpetually
liable to the temptation to draw immense conclusions
from premises that are too narrow and inadequate.
The history of science is a record of the correction
of hasty generalizations by future discoveries, and
leads to the final conviction that there are no laws of nature
which can lay claim to absolute universality. Since
the time of Newton, the law of gravitation has been regarded
by many as strictly universal. But now we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
told by Herschel that "our evidence of the existence of
gravitation fails us beyond the region of the double stars,
or leaves us at best only a <i>presumption</i> amounting to
moral conviction in its favor." Furthermore, in regard
to the luminiferous ether, he tells us that "we are freed
from the necessity of any mental reference to the actual
weight or specific gravity of the material, which in this
case is the more necessary, as, though we suppose the
ethereal molecules to possess inertia, <i>we can not suppose
them affected by the force of gravitation</i>." "Beyond all
doubt, the widest and most interesting prospect of future
discovery ... is that distinction between <i>gravitating</i> and
<i>levitating</i> matter, that positive and unrefutable demonstration
of the existence of a repulsive force ... enormously
more powerful than the attractive force of gravity."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Until recently the presence of free oxygen as the necessary
condition of life has been regarded as a universal
biological law. "But the latest researches of Pasteur
have shown that, so far from oxygen being essential to the
life of the simplest living beings, there are certain forms
of infusoria which not only pass their lives without oxygen,
but are killed by its presence."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Other illustrations might be adduced, but these are sufficient
for our purpose. The truth is, there is not a phenomenon
known to man that can properly be said to be
the result of the action of <i>one</i> invariable and universal
force, not even the falling of a stone to the earth; for
some force must have previously been exerted to raise the
stone from the earth, which force is represented by energy
of position, or "potential energy."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> And this poten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>tial
energy is the exact numerical equivalent of the energy
of motion which it acquires in falling&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the mass
multiplied by the square of the velocity. Every event,
every change in nature, is due to "some <i>variable</i> combinations
of invariable forces."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Material causes are always
complex. Every law of nature is liable to counteraction
and modification by other laws, and the most fundamental
fact of the universe is that material forces are adjusted,
combined, and modified in endless modes in order to the
fulfillment of purposes and ends. The phenomena of life
present a vast series of such adjustments and modifications.
The mechanical and chemical forces are controlled
and subordinated by the vital force, so that life has been
defined as "a <i>resistance</i> to the physical forces of matter"<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>&mdash;a
resistance which Liebig regards as in a certain degree
invincible. Living matter is the seat of energy, and so
long as it is living, can overcome the primary law of the
<i>inertia</i> of matter, and moves spontaneously.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Living matter
overcomes the attraction of gravitation, and resists, suspends,
and modifies the action of chemical affinity.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> It is
in direct opposition to chemical affinity that organized beings
exist.</p>

<p>Thus the various forms of energy are mutually conditioned.
The mechanical, chemical, and electrical energies
are counteracted by the vital force. And all the forces
and energies of nature are controlled and subordinated by
a higher force which orders means to ends, and adapts
structure to function, viz., an <i>Intelligent Will</i>. The conviction
finally becomes irresistible that nature is a system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of things designed to be subject to Mind, and that a law
of design is the highest law of the universe.</p>

<p>It must now be obvious that we can reach no definite
conclusion in regard to the question under discussion&mdash;the
uniformity of nature&mdash;unless we have a clear and precise
conception of the meaning of the term "nature."
The word is employed, even by men of science, in a very
loose and ambiguous sense. At one time it is used to
denote the totality of sensible phenomena; at another,
the conditions or causes of phenomena; again, the relations
of phenomena; and often, all these collectively.
We must endeavor to extricate ourselves from this
confusion.</p>

<p>According to its derivation, nature (<i>natura</i>&mdash;<i>nascitur</i>)
means that which is born or produced&mdash;<i>the becoming</i>;
that which has a beginning and an end; that which has
not the cause of its existence in itself, and the cause of
which must be sought in something antecedent to and beyond
itself&mdash;that is, nature is <i>the phenomenal</i>. This the
word itself expresses in the strongest manner. That which
begins to be, as the necessary consequence of antecedent
conditions, is <i>natural</i>. The co-existence, resemblance, and
succession of phenomena constitute the <i>order of nature</i>;
and the uniformity of these relations among phenomena
are the <i>laws of nature</i>. So much is clear from the stand-point
of mere empirical science. Now if law is "the uniformity
of relations among phenomena,"<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> then it is equally
clear that the phrase "uniformity of natural law" is meaningless,
for, by the definition, the uniformity itself is the
law, and the expression is simply equivalent to "the uniformity
of the uniformity," which is absurd. Furthermore,
if "nature" is the phenomenal&mdash;the becoming&mdash;then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
word can not be properly employed to denote the causes
of that becoming, unless by causes we understand antecedent
conditions, which, as we shall presently see, are not
real causes. Nature, or the sum-total of phenomena, is an
<i>effect</i>&mdash;an effect which demands a cause. There can be no
phenomena without change, no change without motion, no
motion without force, no force without Spirit, for Spirit-force
is the only force of which we have any knowledge
or consciousness. A rational Will, and not a blind necessity,
must stand at the fountain-head of being, and uniformity
in nature must be the result of <i>reason</i> and <i>choice</i>.</p>

<p>But suppose we are permitted to employ the term "nature"
to denote the essential properties of matter, and the
various forms of energy,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> potential and kinetic; and suppose
we admit that matter is indestructible, and that the
amount of energy in the world is unchanged, the sum of
the actual and potential energies being a constant quantity;
still we are not entitled from these premises to infer
the absolute uniformity in the succession of events&mdash;that is,
the uniformity of the phenomenal. We have already seen
that no phenomenon known to man is the result of a single
property of matter or a single form of energy. "All
issues in nature are the effects produced upon matter by
the resultant of component forces." The phenomena of
nature are the result of adjustments, combinations, and
distributions of matter and of force in endless variety and
complexity. Hence we have in nature the variable, the
contingent, the particular, as well as the invariable, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
uniform, and the general. This is admitted by Comte:
"That which engenders this <i>irregular variability</i> of the
effect is the great number of different agents determining
at the same time the same phenomena; and from which
it results, in the most complicated phenomena, <i>that there
are no two cases precisely alike</i>. We have no occasion, in
order to find such complexity, to go to the phenomena of
living beings. It presents itself in bodies without life, for
example, in studying meteorological phenomena.... <i>Their
multiplicity renders the effects as irregularly variable as
if every cause had not been subject to any precise condition.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Thus we are led by various lines of thought to the same
conclusion. It is certain that we can only learn what the
uniformities (the laws) of nature are by <i>experience</i>, and
in order to determine whether all the successions of events
have been and now are universally uniform, we must have
a <i>universal</i> experience. If there have been deviations
from general laws under peculiar conditions&mdash;if one form
of energy has been counteracted and modified by another
form of energy, or even by an intelligent Will, so as to
give a <i>particular</i> result&mdash;experience (= observation and
testimony) must be just as adequate to attest the reality
of that particular deviation as it is to attest the prevalence
of general laws.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> We have no intuitive and necessary
conviction of the uniformity of nature, and therefore
we can not affirm in an <i>à priori</i> manner what is <i>possible</i>
or <i>impossible</i>. Those scientists who adopt the maxim of
Faraday, that in the investigation of new and peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
phenomena "we must set out with clear ideas of the possible
and the impossible," are doomed to move in a vicious
circle. They can not be sure that a fact of experience is
a real fact until they have ascertained the laws of nature
in the case, and they can not ascertain what the laws of
nature are until they have ascertained the facts. They
must not profess to have learned any thing until they have
ascertained that it is possible, and they can not decide that
it is possible until they have learned every thing, because
the single item of knowledge they are deficient in may be
the very principle which warrants a belief in the possibility
of the fact. The maxim is obviously absurd. In
its theological bearings it is repudiated even by Professor
Tyndall, the pupil and successor of Faraday at the Royal
Institution. "You never hear the really philosophical defenders
of the doctrine of uniformity speaking of <i>impossibilities</i>
in nature. They never say ... that it is impossible
for the Builder of the universe to alter his work.
Their business is not with the possible, but with the actual."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>The hypothesis under discussion is further vitiated by
the assumption that laws are <i>causes</i> adequate in themselves
to the production of all phenomena. So that now
Creation by Law (Nomogeny) is the watchword of this
school of thinkers. The men who have defined law as
"the uniformity of relations among phenomena"&mdash;as "an
observed order of facts"&mdash;now speak of laws as having in
themselves a real efficiency; as producing, regulating, and
governing powers. Under this high-sounding phrase&mdash;"Creation
by Law"&mdash;there is not only the artful concealment
of a difficulty, but there is also the interpolation of
a positive error. The <i>uniformities</i> of natural phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
are the <i>causes</i> of phenomena, or, in other words, the order
of nature is its own cause, which is not only erroneous but
self-contradictory.</p>

<p>Here, again, we encounter the perplexity consequent on
the use of ambiguous phraseology. The term "Law" is
employed in an equivocal sense, as denoting, indifferently,
property and relation, condition and cause, antecedent and
consequence. In such an atmosphere of verbal haze it is
impossible to see clearly or think correctly. We must feel
our way toward a purer light, and find a less wavering
stand-point.</p>

<p>The primary and generic conception of law is "<i>the authoritative
expression of Will</i>." This is the most natural,
the most obvious, and the most legitimate conception.
The true notion of Will is the synthesis of Reason and
Power. Power exerted in the forms of reason is self-consciousness.
Reason manifested in the forms of power is
self-determination. Self-consciousness and self-determination
are the two elements of personality. More explicitly,
we may therefore define law as "<i>the idea of the Reason
enforced by Power</i>." The subjects of legislation are:</p>

<p>1. <i>The actions of Free Beings.</i> To ascertain the laws in
this case is to answer the question, What <i>ought</i> to be done?</p>

<p>2. <i>The processes of Thought.</i> To ascertain the laws
in this case is to answer the questions, Why do we judge
or affirm this or that? and, What are the grounds and criteria
of certitude?</p>

<p>3. <i>The facts or events of Nature.</i> To ascertain the
laws in this case is to answer the questions, <i>What</i> are the
facts in their observed order? <i>How</i> or from what causes
do they arise? <i>Why</i> or for what end do they exist?</p>

<p>It is under the last division that we encounter the secondary
and symbolical senses in which the term law has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
come to be used by scientific men, which have well-nigh
supplanted the primary and only legitimate signification.</p>

<p>That which lies nearest to sense&mdash;the phenomena of
nature&mdash;first engages the awakening intellect. If the attention
is confined solely to the phenomena of nature, the
simple question propounded is, <i>What</i> is the observed order
of the facts? At this stage science can be no more
than a classification of phenomena according to their relations
of co-existence, resemblance, and succession, and law
must be defined as "<i>the uniformity of relations among
phenomena</i>."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Here the term is taken <i>objectively</i>, and
the facts are simply conceived as perceived by the senses.</p>

<p>But the human mind can never rest in the bare knowledge
of phenomena. The reason intuitively recognizes
the uniformities of nature as the suggestive signs of properties
or powers which are not perceptible to sense, and
the question arises, <i>How</i>&mdash;that is, from what adjustment
of antecedent conditions and physical agencies&mdash;does the
order of nature arise? And now the term law comes
to indicate more than an observed order of facts; it denotes
an order resulting from the coincidence of some
permanent properties, qualities, or forces which are conceived
as lying back of the phenomena, and pushing them
into the objective field. Accordingly, laws are now defined
as "<i>the necessary relations which spring from the
[inner] nature of things</i>."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Here the phrase is taken
<i>subjectively</i>, as the expression of a mental conception, and
not of a sense perception. "It has relation to us as <i>understanding</i>,
rather than to the materials of which the
universe consists as obeying certain rules."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, the human mind approaches the question&mdash;<i>Why</i>
have these physical agencies been so collocated or
adjusted? What relation does this adjustment bear to
<i>purpose</i>, <i>intention</i>, or <i>end</i>? Law is now <i>the reason or
end for which an orderly arrangement exists</i>. Here the
phrase is taken ideally or <i>rationally</i> as a revelation of the
intuitive reason, in the light of which the phenomena of
nature find their only satisfactory interpretation.</p>

<p>By this route we are led back to the primary and universal
conception of law as "<i>the idea of the Reason enforced
by Power</i>." All government, human or Divine, is
the enforcement of ideas by authority, and "Natural Law"
is the actualization of the Divine idea by the Divine efficiency.
As Bunsen remarks, "Law is the supreme rule
of the universe, and this law is Intellect, is <i>Reason</i>, whether
viewed in the formation of a planetary system or the
organization of a worm."</p>

<p>Laws and ideas are thus correlated. Viewed in respect
to the reason as conceiving, originating, and projecting,
we speak of the <i>idea</i>. Viewed in respect to the
sphere of determinate movement and action in which ideas
are realized and actualized, we speak of <i>law</i>. Hence
Plato often calls ideas laws; and Lord Bacon, the British
Plato, describes the laws of the material world as ideas:
"<i>Quod in naturâ naturatâ lex, in naturâ naturante idea
dicitur</i>."</p>

<p>It is obvious, then, that laws are not attributes of matter,
but of intelligence. It is equally obvious that laws
are not efficient causes, and can not execute themselves.
They are the ideas and purposes of reason, and the rules
or methods according to which the ideas are actualized.
Law, therefore, presupposes a <i>Lawgiver</i> and an <i>Executive</i>.
Law without a lawgiver is the merest abstraction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
law without an agent to realize and execute it is, in fact,
not a law, but an idea. To maintain that the universe is
governed by laws, without ascending to the superior reason
and source of these laws&mdash;to talk of laws, and yet not
to recognize that every law implies a legislator, and an executor
to put it in force&mdash;is to hypostatize laws, to make
beings of them, and to substitute mythical and fabulous
divinities in the place of the one living and true God, the
source of all power and all law.</p>

<p>Few men of recent times can claim a larger acquaintance
with the history and the philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences than the late Professor Whewell, and he may be
fairly regarded as expressing the doctrine of the best scientists.
"A law supposes an <i>agent</i> and a <i>power</i>: for it
is a mode according to which the power acts. Without
the presence of such an agent, of such a power, conscious
of the relations on which the law depends, producing the
effects which the law prescribes, the law can have no efficiency,
no existence. Hence we infer that the intelligence
by which the law is ordained, the power by which it is
put in action, must be present in all places where the effects
of the law occur; that thus the knowledge and
agency of the Divine Being pervade every portion of the
universe, producing all action and passion, all permanence
and change. <i>The laws of nature are the laws which He
in his wisdom prescribes to his own acts</i>; his universal
presence is the necessary condition of any course of events,
his universal agency the only origin of any efficient force."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>We grant that the term law may, by metonymy, be employed
to designate "the uniformity of relations among
phenomena," but then it must not be forgotten that here
the effect is put for the cause, the consequence of law for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the law itself. It may be that this is the only conception
of law which is legitimate within the sphere of strictly
physical science, and to limit the scientists solely to the
knowledge of phenomena and their relations would simply
be to take them at their word. The inquiry concerning
Causes and First Principles must then, by common consent,
be surrendered to pure metaphysics and theology.
But if, after this truce, the scientist still persists in speaking
of laws as efficient causes, and claiming for them "an
eternal and necessary uniformity," thus virtually denying
the liberty and personality of God, and the possibility of
Creation and Providence, the Christian Theist must be
permitted in the name of polemic fairness and logical consistency
to protest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br/>
CONSERVATION.&mdash;THE RELATION OF GOD TO THE WORLD.<br />
(<i>Continued.</i>)</h2>


<p>Of the various hypotheses which seek to dispense with
the immediate agency of God, and to explain the conservation
of the world by "secondary" or natural agencies,
the second is that of <i>active Force communicated to matter
at its creation</i>. This force being transformable, and at
the same time indestructible, is regarded as adequate to
the conservation of the universe.</p>

<p>This hypothesis must not be confounded with the Dynamical
theory of matter propounded by Leibnitz, and
more fully elaborated by Boscovich, which regards matter
as a mere phenomenon or function of force; on the contrary,
it conceives of matter as a distinct entity moving
under the action of a primary impulse communicated by
"the Creator's fiat at the beginning." This hypothesis
in its fundamental conception and its further elaboration
is purely mechanical. It represents the universe as a
machine first set in motion by the Deity, and conserved
by the actions and reactions of its several parts. All subsequent
motions, changes, and configurations are the prolonged
results of the original impulse, without any further
direct action or control on the part of the Creator.</p>

<p>A more precise and accurate statement would require
that the term "Energy" should be substituted for "Force."
In the language of modern physics, <i>Force</i> is "that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
<i>originates</i> or tends to originate motion or change," and
"is <i>wholly expended</i> in the action it produces."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> All energy
has its origin in force, but force can not pass into
energy except under conditions in which it is at liberty to
act. For instance, the <i>force</i> of gravity produces the <i>energy</i>
of motion of a falling body, but gravity can not produce
motion unless there is space through which the body
can fall. <i>Energy</i>, therefore, is defined as "the power of
doing work."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The work done is the resistance overcome,
and in overcoming resistance the energy is transformed,
but not annihilated. In every case in which energy is
lost by resistance, heat is generated; and we learn from
Joule's investigations that the quantity of heat generated
is a perfectly definite equivalent for the energy lost. It
is therefore claimed that the total quantity of energy in the
universe is constant, and that the material system is dynamically
conservative. The universe is a self-acting and
self-sustained machine, and perpetual motion is a necessary
consequence.</p>

<p>A little reflection, however, ought to convince any one
that this conception of the universe&mdash;as a machine which
is kept in perpetual motion by the reciprocal action of its
parts&mdash;is a false analogy. And its fallacy is apparent
from this, that the moving force of every machine is not
inherent in the machine, but some natural primary force
distinct from the machine, such as gravity, or the primary
atomic forces of attraction and repulsion; and consequently
the very idea of mechanism <i>assumes</i> the existence of
those primary forces of which it is the professed object
of a mechanical theory of the universe to give an explanation.
A machine "can no more create energy than it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
create matter;" its sole function is "to transform energy
into a kind most convenient for us."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> "We may with the
greatest ease convert mechanical work into heat, but we
can not by any means convert all the energy of heat back
again into mechanical work. In the steam-engine we do
what can be done in this way, but it is a very small portion
of the whole energy of the heat that is convertible
into work, for a large portion is dissipated, and will continue
to be dissipated however perfect our engine may become.
Let the greatest care be taken in the construction
and working of a steam-engine, yet we shall not succeed
in converting one fourth of the whole energy of the heat
of the coals into mechanical work."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> It is impossible to
construct a machine that can do work without parting
with energy; and when the energy is all parted with, any
machine whatever must necessarily cease to do any more
work unless a fresh supply of energy be brought in from
without. It is impossible to make a water-mill work without
a constantly renewed supply of water, or to make a
steam-engine work without a constantly renewed supply
of fuel. "Every one who understands mechanics knows
that any such inexhaustible supply of energy is impossible
by means of merely mechanical arrangements; but it is
equally true, though not perhaps equally so evident, that
it is impossible by means of any arrangement of thermal,
electric, or chemical forces."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>But we are told that modern science has proved that
the law of the Conservation of Energy is an absolute law
of the universe, and that though man can not construct a
machine which will realize the dream of perpetual motion,
the material universe is in reality such a machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
It becomes us to speak with some degree of diffidence in
regard to a question which lies outside of our special department
of study. Nevertheless we must confess that
we have a growing suspicion of all so-called "absolute
laws" in the domain of physical nature. And we are
confirmed in this mistrust by the fact that physicists themselves
are not agreed in regarding this law of conservation
of energy as universally true. "That the amount of
energy in the world is unchangeable, the sum of the actual
or kinetic and potential energies being a constant quantity,
has been by some writers overstrained. It may be
taken as a postulate, and is probably true, but it is a proposition
equally incapable of proof and of disproof."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
"This principle," says Sir J. Herschel, "so far as it rests
upon any scientific basis as a legitimate conclusion from
dynamical laws, is no other than the well-known dynamical
theorem of the conservation of <i>vis viva</i> (or of 'energy,'
as some prefer to call it), <i>supplemented to save the
truth of its verbal enunciation</i> by the introduction of
what is called 'potential energy,' a phrase which I can
not help regarding as unfortunate, inasmuch as it goes to
substitute a truism for the announcement of a dynamical
fact. No such conservation, in the sense of an identity of
total amount of <i>vis viva</i> at all times and in all circumstances,
in fact, exists. So far as a system is maintained
by the mutual actions and reactions of its constituent elements
<i>at a distance</i> (<i>i. e.</i>, by force), <i>vis viva</i> may temporarily
disappear, and be subsequently reproduced between
certain limits. Collision, indeed, between its ultimate particles
or atoms, regarded as absolutely rigid, and therefore
inelastic (<i>for that which can not change its figure can
have no resilience</i>), can not take place without producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
a permanent destruction of it, which there exists no means
of repairing.... If, indeed, we could be assured <i>à priori</i>
that the system [of the universe] is one of simple or compound
periodicity, in which a certain lapse of time will
restore every molecule to identically the same relative situation
with respect to all the rest, we should then be sure
that in the nature of things there would take place, so to
speak, a winding up from a lower to a higher state of potential
energy, to be subsequently exchanged for newly created
<i>vis viva</i>. But, as we can have no such <i>à priori</i> assurance,
can only assume such restoration to be possible, and
can see no means of effecting it, if possible, otherwise than
by foresight and prearrangement; the one equally with the
other is an unknown function, variable within unknown
limits, and susceptible of fluctuation to an unknown extent;
nor can we have any, the smallest, right to assert that
what is expended in one form <i>is</i> necessarily laid up for
further use in the other. It would be very difficult, I apprehend,
to show whether, in the winding up of a clock or
the building of a pyramid, taking into consideration all
the various modes in which <i>vis viva</i> disappears and reappears
in the expenditure of muscular power, the evolution
of animal heat, the consumption of the materials
of our tissues, the propagation of vibratory motions, and
a thousand other modes of transfer, the total <i>vis viva</i>
of this our planet is increased or diminished. That it
should remain absolutely unchanged during the process is
in the last degree inconceivable. The amount of <i>vis viva</i>
latent in the form of heat or molecular motion in the sun
and planets in our immediate system may bear, and probably
does bear, a by no means inappreciable ratio to that
more distinctly patent in the form of bodily motion in the
periodic circulation of the planets round the sun, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
sun and planets round their axes. The latter amount fluctuates
to and fro according to laws easily calculable, <i>but
the former we have no means whatever of computing, and
to what extent, or within what limits, it may be variable,
we are altogether ignorant</i>."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The two dynamical laws of Conservation of Energy and
Transformation of Energy can not therefore be regarded
as universal and absolute laws; they are particular and
derivative laws subject to limitations which are supplied
by the third dynamical law&mdash;the Dissipation of Energy.
The law of the conservation of energy simply asserts
"that the whole amount of energy in the universe, or in
any limited system which does not receive energy from
without, or part with it to external matter, is invariable;"
in other words, that every material system subject to no
other forces than actions and reactions between its parts
is a dynamically conservative system. But Sir William
Thomson has shown that "in nature this hypothetical condition
is apparently violated in all circumstances of motion.
A material system can never be brought through
any returning cycle of motion without spending more
work against the mutual forces of its parts than is gained
from these forces, because no relative motion can take
place without meeting with frictional or other forms of
resistance."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> "There can be but one ultimate result for
such a system as that of the sun and planets, if continuing
long enough under existing laws, and not disturbed by
meeting with other moving masses in space. That result
is the falling together of all into one mass, which, although
rotating for a time, <i>must in the end come to rest relatively
to the surrounding medium</i>."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>The law of the transformation of energy is "the enunciation
of the empirical fact that in general any one form
of energy may by suitable processes be transformed, wholly
or in part, to an equivalent amount in any other given
form." This law, however, is subject to limitations which
are supplied by the dissipation of energy. "No known
natural process is exactly reversible, and whenever an attempt
is made to transform and retransform energy by an
imperfect process, part of the energy is necessarily transformed
into heat and <i>dissipated</i>, so as to be incapable of
further useful transformation. It therefore follows that,
as energy is constantly in a state of transformation, there
is a constant <i>degradation</i> of energy to the final unavailable
form of uniformly diffused heat, and that will go on
until the whole energy of the universe has taken this final
form."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> No mechanical work can be done by heat in a
state of equilibrium; as a dynamical agent it is <i>dead</i>.
"Thus the inexorable laws of mechanics indicate that the
store of force in our planetary system, which can only suffer
loss and not gain, must be finally exhausted."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>So far, then, as the conservation of energy has any
scientific meaning, it is inadequate to account for the origin
or explain the continuance of the existing order of
nature. It is true we may conceive that every atom of
matter was endowed at the Creation with a certain store
of potential energy&mdash;"the potential energy of gravitation"<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>&mdash;which
it has ever since given out; but as every
motion which has resulted from its action has been attended
with the expenditure of a certain amount of the original
endowment, it must have been continually undergoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
a diminution. There is, says Professor Norton, no escaping
this conclusion but by taking the ground that <i>the primary
atomic forces</i> (as gravitation, and the atomic repulsion
and attraction by which atoms are aggregated into bodies
of sensible magnitude) are correlated with the <i>living forces</i>
(or various forms of energy) which are involved in the
motions that have resulted from the previous operation of
the primary atomic forces. "But," he says, "<i>no evidence
has been obtained of any such correlation</i>." The primary
force of attraction (if it be regarded as a primary
force) may be the cause of motion in bodies which are separated
in space, and part of that energy of motion may be
transformed into the energy of heat or light or electricity,
but the primary force of attraction is not transformed.
Energy is convertible into other forms of energy, but heat,
light, and electricity are not transformable into primary
force. The correlation of force and energy is therefore a
scientific heresy.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Modern physicists are agreed that visible motion, heat,
electricity, magnetism, and radiance (radiant light and
heat) are forms of actual <i>energy</i> which are correlated and
capable of mutual conversion. Any one form may, by
suitable processes, be transformed, wholly or in part, to an
equivalent amount of any other form of energy. So much
is generally accepted by scientific men.</p>

<p>But in regard to the primary <i>force</i> or forces in which
these forms of energy have their origin, there is not the
same agreement among physicists. Some regard gravitation,
cohesion, and chemical affinity as the three primary
forces of nature; while others suggest that the last two
are related with and probably derived from the first.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>There is also a respectable school of physicists who teach
that atomic attractions and repulsions are the universal
cosmic forces which originate all molecular and mechanical
motions. Then, again, each of these forms of force
have their special advocates. On the one side it is affirmed,
as an important generalization, that all primary
force is <i>attractive</i>; "there is no such thing in nature as
a primary repulsive force."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Universal attraction is the
one world-forming and world-conserving energy. On the
other side it is contended that gravitation is not a primary,
but a secondary and derivative force, and that the grand
primal force is a universal force of <i>repulsion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>It is beyond our province to discuss the merits of these
conflicting theories. Our position is that no purely physical
hypothesis is adequate to account for the conservation
of the universe, and therefore it is of little consequence
to our argument which of the above theories may
find most favor with scientific men. The tendency of
modern scientific thought is toward the conception of "one
primordial form of matter, and but one primary form of
force," as the simplest basis upon which a physical theory
of inanimate nature can be erected. The ultimate nature
of this one primary force is a question for pure metaphysics.
From the stand-point of physical science it can
only be thought "as a <i>pull</i> or a <i>push</i> in a straight line."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Universal attraction or universal repulsion must be the
ultimate dynamical conception for the pure physicist.</p>

<p>1. Let us consider the first hypothesis. It is claimed
that gravitation, or universal attraction, is the great con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>serving
and sustaining principle of the universe. A stone
falls to the earth, a round body rolls along a plane inclined
toward the horizon; a liquid mass, as a brook or a
large river, flows on the sloping surface which forms its
bed. All these phenomena are the varied manifestation
of a universal <i>tendency</i> in all bodies to fall one toward the
other. In virtue of this tendency the great orbs which
hang suspended in space gravitate toward one another;
the moon and the earth fall toward each other, and they
both gravitate toward the sun. All the planets of our
solar system continually act one on the other, and on the
immense sphere which shines at their common focus. By
its enormous mass, the sun keeps all of them in their orbits.
If we ask why one body <i>falls</i> toward another which
is more than ninety millions of miles off, in preference to
moving in any other direction, the answer given is that,
"Every particle of matter in the universe <i>attracts</i> every
other particle with a force whose direction is that of the
line joining the two, and whose magnitude is directly as
the product of their masses, and inversely as the square of
their distance from each other." This force of attraction
is the universal bond which holds the universe together,
and sustains its physical life.</p>

<p>To the superficial thinker, the language of the Newtonian
philosophy appears to sanction the materialistic notion
that gravitation and attraction are active powers essential
to and inherent in matter. Such, however, was by
no means the doctrine of Newton, and he was careful to
guard his readers against any such misapprehension of his
meaning. "The words attraction, repulsion, or tendencies
of whatever kind toward a centre, I use indifferently and
without distinction for each other, considering these forces
not physically but metaphysically. Wherefore let not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
reader suppose that by words of this kind I any where
mean a species or mode of action, or cause, or physical
reason; or that I really and in a physical sense assign
forces to centres (which are only mathematical points),
even though I may say that centres <i>attract</i>, or that <i>forces
belong to centres</i>."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The history of scientific opinion on the point before us
furnishes a striking illustration of the manner in which
language reacts on the ideas which it is intended to express,
and thus men fall into the habit of talking nonsense
without knowing it. The conception of atoms having the
property of exerting various forces across a void space
seemed to follow as a matter of course from the discovery
of the law of gravitation, and from the language in which
it is expressed. After Newton a school arose which taught
that atoms have the property of <i>exerting force at a distance</i>,
and that this property must be inherent in the
atoms, just as Lucretius taught that hardness and elasticity
were original indefeasible properties of the primordial elements,
the "semina rerum," or seeds of things. But
Newton did not teach this; he stated a fact, but did not
devise an hypothesis; he attempted no explanation of the
law of gravitation.</p>

<p>"The law of gravitation considered as a <i>result</i> is beautifully
simple; in a few words it expresses a fact from
which most numerous and complex results may be deduced
by mere reasoning&mdash;results found invariably to agree
with the records of observation; but this same law of
gravitation looked upon as an axiom or first principle is
so astonishingly far removed from all ordinary experience
as to be almost incredible. What! every particle in the
whole universe is actively attracting <i>every other particle</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
[that is, every particle in the universe with the same
force, without any expenditure of force], through void,
without the aid of any communication by means of matter,
or otherwise&mdash;each particle, unchecked by distance, unimpeded
by obstacles, throws this miraculous influence to
infinite distance without the employment of any means!<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
No particle interferes with its neighbor, but all these wonderful
influences are co-existent in every point in space!
The result is apparent at each particle, but the condition
of intermediate space is exactly the same as though no
such influence were being transmitted across it! Earth
attracts Sirius across space, and yet the space between is
as if neither Earth nor Sirius existed! Can these things
be? We think not; and Newton himself did not affirm
this."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> On the contrary, he earnestly rejects any such hypothesis.
"It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter
should, without the mediation of something else <i>which
is not material</i>, operate upon and affect other matter without
mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation, in the
sense of Epicurus, be essential to and inherent in matter....
That gravitation should be innate, inherent, and essential
to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a
distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of any
thing else, by and through which their action and force
may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great
an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical
matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall
into it. <i>Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly
according to certain laws.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancient axiom that "Matter can not act where it is
not any more than when it is not," was universally believed
till Newton's time, and Newton himself regarded
it as a self-evident truth. Some of his disciples asserted
that gravitation must be considered as an essential property
of matter, and they were under the necessity of assuming
that atoms can exert a force upon one another
across a void. This to Leibnitz was either miraculous or
absurd; and in modern times the doctrine is rejected by
the first physicists&mdash;by Faraday, Helmholtz, Thomson,
Tait, and Maxwell.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Sir William Thomson, the Newton
of modern physics, says emphatically, "I have no faith
whatever in attractions and repulsions <i>acting at a distance</i>
between centres of force according to various laws."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
And Clerk Maxwell, in his lecture on "Action at a Distance,"<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
explains how Faraday, by his discovery of magnetic
rotation of polarized light, and by his showing how
lines of force arise in media, "rudely shook the theory of
attraction and repulsion at a distance across a void."</p>

<p>If, now, "direct action at a distance" is rejected by scientific
men as inconceivable and absurd, how can it be
that the sun <i>pulls</i> the earth toward it, and holds the planets
in their orbits? The verbal statement of the law of
gravitation is no answer to this question. It expresses a
fact, but it does not assign a cause. Gravitation is a phenomenon
which demands an explanation, and some of the
first scientists of the day are engaged in devising a theory
which shall afford a rational answer to the question, What
is the <i>cause</i> of gravity?<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>The first and most fundamental presupposition for any
physical hypothesis which seeks to explain the action of
gravitation is that some <i>medium</i> of communication exists.
This is suggested by every physical analogy. Sound is
communicated through a medium. The influence which
is exerted at a distance by heat, light, electricity, and magnetism
is effected through media. The most plausible
suggestion yet made is that "a single omnipresent fluid,
<i>ether</i>, fills the universe," which by various forms or modes
of motion transmits light, radiant heat, magnetism, and
electricity.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> May not gravitation, it is asked, be transmitted
by the <i>same</i> fluid? may it not consist of or result from
actual recurring impulses propagated in ethereal waves?</p>

<p>The hypothesis that gravitation is transmitted through
the same medium as light, or indeed through any medium,
is encumbered with serious if not insuperable difficulties.
All transmission of whatever kind&mdash;of a letter by the post,
a gunshot, a sound, a wave of light, an electro-magnetic
disturbance&mdash;<i>occupies time</i>. It has a velocity&mdash;sometimes
a very great one, as in the case of light; still it is a measurable
velocity. But, according to Herschel, the pull
which the sun exerts on the earth is delivered <i>instantaneously</i>.
Were it not so there would be "a continually
progressive increase of the major axis of the earth's orbit,
and therefore of the length of the year."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Surely it must
be obvious to every one that the <i>instantaneous</i> transmission
of the sun's attractive force to the planet Neptune,
three thousand millions of miles distant, through a physical
medium like the ether, would be as great a miracle
as action at a distance through a perfect void. But the
advocates of this hypothesis have not thereby escaped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
difficulties of action at a distance. The majority of physicists
regard the luminiferous ether as consisting of "discrete
particles"&mdash;"elementary molecules of inconceivable
minuteness and tenuity." These ultimate particles or
atoms of highly attenuated matter must have some magnitude,
some extension, however inconceivably minute. If
extended, they must have some form, and must occupy
separate positions in space. If they are capable of
motions&mdash;undulatory,
rotatory, or spiral motions&mdash;they can not be
in mutual contact. Conceive, then, two such atoms, and
draw around each an imaginary circle. Let these circles
touch at the middle point between the two, and ask yourself
the question, What exists there? On the hypothesis
under consideration you are bound to answer pure, empty
space&mdash;that is, pure nothing. "But if there is no matter between
the atoms, then all their actions, one upon the other,
must be exerted across a void&mdash;that is, through a medium
of nothingness;" in other words, through no medium
at all. Now the size of the interval makes no difference
in the argument. "Whether that interval be the 92 billionth
of an inch, or the 92 millions of miles or thereabouts
between the earth and the sun, it is still action at
a distance, and no escape."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>The physicist who regards the ether as consisting of
discrete particles not in bodily or actual contact, and at the
same time finds himself logically compelled to reject this
"mystical action at a distance," has no alternative but to
accept the doctrine of Newton that the action of one particle
of matter upon another is mediated by an agent
which is not <i>material</i>. "If it be true that the conception
of <i>force</i> as the originator of motion in matter without
bodily contact ... is essential to the right interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of phenomena; and if it be equally true, on the other hand,
that its exertion makes itself manifest to our personal consciousness
by that peculiar sensation of <i>effort</i> which is not
without its analogue in purely intellectual acts of the
mind, it [<i>i. e.</i>, force] comes not unnaturally to be regarded
as affording a point of contact, a connecting link between
these two great departments of being&mdash;between mind and
matter&mdash;the one as the <i>originator</i>, the other as the <i>recipient</i>
of force."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>There are distinguished physicists&mdash;as Helmholtz, Thomson,
Challis, and Maxwell&mdash;who seek to escape the difficulties
of action at a distance by the assumption that the
ether is absolutely continuous (and therefore does not consist
of atoms)&mdash;a perfectly homogeneous, incompressible,
frictionless fluid which fills the universe. This fundamental
presupposition as the basis of a physical theory
of the universe necessitates the further assumption that
"<i>motion is the very essence of what has been hitherto
called matter</i>."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> All quantitative and qualitative phenomena,
all statical and dynamical phenomena, are due
solely to varied modes of motion in the primordial fluid.
"By various motions of the nature of eddies [ring-vortices],
the qualities of matter&mdash;cohesion, elasticity, hardness,
weight, mass, or other universal properties of matter&mdash;are
given to small <i>portions</i> of the fluid which constitute the
<i>chemical atom</i>, and these, by modifications in their combinations,
form, and motion, produce the accidental phenomena
of <i>gross matter</i>.... On this view, gross matter
would be merely an assemblage of <i>parts</i> of the medium
moving in a peculiar way, groups of ring-vortices having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
inertia.... The primary fluid by other motions transmits
light, radiant heat, magnetism, and <i>gravitation</i>."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>It may be regarded as an act of presumption in an obscure
critic to offer an opinion of the theories of these
great masters in science. We venture, however, to suggest
that most men will find a difficulty in conceiving how
space absolutely full of matter can be made to contain
more, or how a truly continuous substance can be capable
of condensation. The most tenuous ether, if it be absolutely
continuous, occupies the whole of the space in which
it lies&mdash;that is, there is no point of the space which is not
occupied by a point of matter.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> But the hardest iron can
do no more than this, and, therefore, on this hypothesis it
seems impossible to account for its greater density. It is
suggested that if molecules are mere assemblages of parts
of the ether moving in a peculiar way, then greater density
may be due to a modification in the motion of molecules,
and not merely to the greater frequency of the eddying
molecules in a given space. But how can a truly continuous
substance have <i>parts</i>, and how can relative motion
occur in an absolute plenum? The very notion of particles
is quite inconsistent with the continuity of matter;
and in a universe absolutely full no motion whatever would
be possible. We are told that Sir William Thomson and
Professor Tait find no difficulty in all these, to our minds,
contradictory conceptions, and therefore we must conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
that our intellect is not properly "focussed so as to give
definition without prenumbral haze."</p>

<p>Granting, then, the absolute continuity of all matter,
and the possibility of motion in an absolute plenum, the
question which concerns us most in this essay is, How is
motion generated and sustained? One of the greatest
lights of this new school tells us that "all we can affirm
of matter is that it is the <i>recipient</i> of impulse and of energy."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
They no longer regard the atom "as a mystic
point endowed with inertia and the attribute of <i>attracting</i>
and <i>repelling</i> other such centres with forces depending on
the intervening distances."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> They have "no faith whatever
in <i>attractions</i> and <i>repulsions</i> acting at a distance between
centres of force."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Force, then, is not regarded by
these leading physicists as an inherent attribute of matter.
The primary fluid, originally inert and motionless, must
have been set in motion by some force, by some agency
external to and distinct from itself. An "original impetus"
<i>from without</i>, according to Maxwell,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> or a "pressure"
of the universal ether "from somewhere <i>outside</i> the
world of stars," according to Challis,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> must be the source
of all motion and all forms of energy in the universe.</p>

<p>It is a fundamental principle of dynamics that "force
is wholly expended in the action it produces,"<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> therefore,
if all the forms of energy in the universe are the result
of pressure, that pressure must be <i>continuous</i>; if they are
the result of impulses, these impulses must be <i>incessantly
renewed</i>, and must recur with immeasurable rapidity. On
either supposition, "the universe is not even temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
automatic, but must be fed from moment to moment by
an agency external to itself," and "the preservation of the
universe is effected only by the unceasing expenditure of
enormous quantities of work;"<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> that is, it is ceaselessly
sustained by Divine Omnipotence&mdash;"He upholdeth all
things by the word of his power."</p>

<p>So much with respect to the first form of this hypothesis
which regards atomic <i>attraction</i> as the sole world-forming
and world-conserving force. We turn now to that form of
the hypothesis which considers atomic <i>repulsion</i> as the
grand primal force in which all the other physical forces,
even gravitation itself, have their origin.</p>

<p>This view is presented by Professor W. A. Norton, in
his articles "On Cosmical and Molecular Physics" in the
<i>American Journal of Science and Arts</i>. His theory rests
essentially upon the following principles:</p>

<p>1. The doctrine of <i>inertia</i> applied to all matter.</p>

<p>2. The existence of a single primary force of <i>repulsion</i>
exerted by every atom upon every other atom.</p>

<p>3. The existence of but one primary form of <i>elementary
matter</i>, viz., the universal or luminiferous ether; the atoms,
so called, of ordinary matter, and of the electric ether being
but different masses of condensed luminiferous ether.</p>

<p>4. The doctrine of the <i>interception of force</i> by matter.
This is a necessary consequence of the fact that a certain
portion of the propagated force is instantly expended in
imparting motion to the molecules or atoms which it encounters,
and is therefore abstracted from this force.</p>

<p>5. The primary force of repulsion is made up of <i>impulses
recurring with an immeasurable rapidity</i>. This
is no new hypothesis. In all treatises on Mechanics, grav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ity
and all incessant forces are conceived to consist of
an indefinitely great number of impulses taking effect in
a finite interval of time.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> "The ever-recurring pulses of
the primary cosmical force, emanating from all the atoms
of the one primary form of matter, are directly <i>consumed</i>
in communicating opposite movements, or virtual movements,
to every atom in the universe. It is, as I conceive,
because in the existing condition of things the distribution
of matter is unequal in different directions round a
point, and therefore the partial interception of the impulses
of the cosmical force along the different lines of direction
is unequal, that an effective gravitating force exists.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
The entire amount of the cosmical force consumed in any
interval of time is the amount intercepted by all the atoms
of matter, and is independent of the motions that result
from the inequalities just noticed. Gravitation, and molecular
and chemical attractions, which originate in the gravitation
of electric ether toward atoms of ordinary matter,
are then <i>derivative</i> forces incidental to the direct actions
exerted by the cosmical force upon the atoms."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>In a communication from Professor Norton to the author,
he furnishes the following further exposition of his
theory: "If, as I conceive, the primary atomic force is
of the nature of a perpetual emanation from each atom,
and is expended in the act of producing motion, we must
thence infer that the atom is an entity through which a
stream of force is <i>perpetually flowing from the Infinite
Source of all power and all existence</i>. That the primary
force is a force of repulsion, and that the immediate source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of all the forces that are known to take effect upon ordinary
matter is the action of recurring repulsive impulses
upon the atoms of the universal ether, and their subsequent
propagation and partial interception by the atoms
which they encounter, I infer from the fact that this conception
furnishes a rational explanation of all the known
forces and phenomena of inanimate nature."</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the theory of Professor Norton
gives no countenance to the materialistic tendencies of the
physical science of the age. He is decidedly of the opinion
that "force is <i>not</i> an inherent and essential attribute of
matter," and he "devoutly acknowledges that in following
the chain of cause and effect into the precincts of that
most deeply hidden of all mysteries, the origin of force,
<i>we have come into the presence of the Infinite Spirit who
puts forth unceasingly, from every point in the realms of
space, his creative and sustaining power upon the subtile
matter that fills all space, and is the essential substance
of all worlds</i>."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>3. The third hypothesis is that of a <i>plastic nature</i>, intermediate
between God and the material universe, by
which all the phenomena of visible nature are produced.</p>

<p>This hypothesis was first presented (at least in modern
times) by Ralph Cudworth, in his "True Intellectual System
of the Universe."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> In opposition to Democritus, who
explained all phenomena by means of matter and motion;
and also in opposition to Strato, who taught that matter
is the only substance, but at the same time a living and
active force, Cudworth maintains that there is a <i>plastic
nature</i>&mdash;a vital and spiritual, but unconscious energy, dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>tinct
from and created by the Deity, which "doth drudgingly
execute that part of his providence which consisteth
in the regular and orderly motion of matter,"<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and in the
organization and development of plants and animals, "according
to laws prescribed for it by a perfect intellect, and
impressed upon it."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> This <i>plastic nature</i> is an "inferior
kind of life or soul," destitute of all consciousness,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> which,
though it "acts for the sake of ends," does "not know the
reason of what it does," and therefore operates "fatally
and sympathetically."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The arguments urged by Cudworth in support of this
hypothesis are mainly of a negative character. On the
one hand he endeavors to show that force and vitality are
not essential attributes of matter, and on the other hand
that the motion and life of the universe can not be properly
regarded as the direct action of the Deity upon matter.
It is with this latter part of the argument that we
are here immediately concerned. He urges (1) that if
every thing in nature were done immediately by God, it
would render Divine Providence "oporose, solicitous, and
distractious;" and, furthermore, it would be unbecoming
the Divine Majesty, and "indecorous," for God "immediately
to do all the meanest and triflingest things Himself
drudgingly." He maintains (2) that if God do all
things immediately, then he does them "<i>miraculously</i>"&mdash;that
is, "forcibly and violently." And (3) that the immediate
agency of God is inconsistent with that slow and
gradual development of things we see in nature, which
would seem to be a "trifling formality" if the agent were
omnipotent, and especially inconsistent with "those errors
and bunglings which are committed when the matter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
inept and contumacious." "Wherefore it may be concluded
that there is a plastic nature under God which, as
an inferior agent, doth drudgingly execute that part of
his providence which consists in the regular and orderly
motion of matter, yet so that there is also a higher providence,
which, <i>presiding</i> over it, doth often supply the defects
of it, and sometimes <i>overrule</i> it; forasmuch as the
plastic nature can not act electively nor with discretion."
So that, after all, as Plato says, God "is the beginning
and end and middle of all things," and therefore their
being is "<i>as much to be ascribed to his causality as if
Himself had done all things immediately</i> without the
concurrent instrumentality of any subordinate natural
cause."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>There is nothing original in this hypothesis of a plastic
nature except perhaps the name. It is the old <i>anima
mundi</i> of the Platonic physics, a vital soul of the world,
distinct from but created by the Supreme God. It has
reappeared under various names in the history of natural
science, especially in that department which is now comprehended
under the general name of Biology. The
"<i>motus tonico-vitalis</i>" of Stahl, the "animating principle"
of Harvey, the "<i>materia vitæ</i>" of John Hunter, the
"organic force" of Müller, and the "organic agent" of
Dr. Prout, are all but separate names "for an imaginary
principle, or entity, possessing powers and properties which
(however men may try to impress themselves with a contrary
notion) would entitle it to rank as an intelligent
agent. It is true that, according to most of the advocates
of this doctrine, this power is supposed to be superintended
and controlled by the Deity himself, and by this supposition
they have screened themselves against the accu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>sation
of attributing to a creature the powers of the Creator."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Cudworth's hypothesis of a plastic nature has been recently
reproduced, without the slightest recognition of its
paternity, by Joseph John Murphy, under the name of
"<i>unconscious intelligence</i>"&mdash;"a power transcending the
ordinary properties of matter and adapting means to purposes,
presiding over all vital actions, whether formative,
motor, or mental, directing each action to its specific end."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Mr. Murphy is very solicitous that we should not understand
him to teach that "the formative intelligence" which
in nature adapts structure to function is Divine. "I believe,"
he says, "that the Creator has not separately organized
every structure, but has endowed vitalized matter with
intelligence, under the guidance of which it organizes itself."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
This "unconscious intelligence," which builds the
tissues and fashions the organs of plants and animals, becomes
conscious of itself in the deliberate thought of man.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>It is worthy of note that this hypothesis commends itself
to the mind of Murphy by considerations akin to
those which are urged by Cudworth; and especially because
it is supposed to relieve certain moral difficulties connected
with the belief of a Divine purpose in creation&mdash;as,
for example, the existence of parasitic worms which inflict
pain and disease on beings endowed with sensation
and consciousness, and the presence of "immoral instincts"
in higher forms of animal life.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>We readily grant that the relation of God to the existing
order and economy of the world is mysterious; and
we believe that no conceivable hypothesis can deprive it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of this mysteriousness. There are numerous difficulties
which arise from the imperfection of our knowledge and
the limited range of our powers. We see through an obscure
medium, and we know only in part. There are also
difficulties peculiar to individual minds&mdash;intellectual, ethical,
emotional difficulties&mdash;which are the products of a
peculiar culture, or the offspring of certain theoretical prepossessions.
Some of these difficulties may be relieved by
the hypothesis of "unconscious intelligence," but on a further
examination it will be found that this hypothesis is
embarrassed with still greater difficulties and open to more
serious objections both intellectual and moral.</p>

<p>First, there is the difficulty of forming any conception of
"<i>unconscious</i> intelligence." This has been felt by the ablest
minds. "The hypothesis," says Wallace, "has the double
disadvantage of being both unintelligible and incapable of
any kind of proof."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Mivart observes that the phrase will
"to many minds appear to be little less than a contradiction
in terms; the very first condition of an intelligence
being that, if it know any thing, it should at least know
its own existence."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Mr. Murphy tells us that this unconscious
intelligence "adapts means to ends," "it presides
over all vital actions, directing each action to its specific
end."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> But an intelligence adapting means to ends without
any knowledge (consciousness) of either the ends to be
secured or the means to be employed to secure the end
surpasses all comprehension and all belief. We can readily
believe, with Hamilton, that the human mind "exerts
energies and is the subject of modifications" of which it
is not immediately conscious, the combined results of which
are manifested in the complex fact of consciousness. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to call that <i>intelligence</i> which never had a perception, a
thought, an emotion; which has no knowledge of self or
of any thing else; in short, which is not and never was
conscious, is to reduce philosophic terminology to chaos,
and tantalize thought by meaningless words. An intelligent
agent is one who <i>understands</i>, who distinguishes between
subject and object, who knows things in their relations,
who can unite the terms of a relation in thought,
and judge of their congruity or incongruity, all of which are
conscious operations. Intelligence is consciousness (conscientia
= relational knowledge); unconscious intelligence
is unconscious consciousness, unintelligent intelligence,
which is a contradiction and an absurdity.</p>

<p>Secondly, in endeavoring to find the mental stand-point
of Mr. Murphy, in order that we may fairly estimate his
hypothesis, we encounter the still more serious difficulty
of conceiving how unconscious intelligence can exist apart
from some <i>subject</i> or substratum in which it inheres.</p>

<p>We are aware that "the tendency of modern thought"
is to hypostatize force and intelligence, and conceive them
as entities. We have conscientiously made the attempt
again and again to realize this conception, but we must
confess we can only conceive of force and intelligence as
properties or attributes of some subject. It is beyond our
ability, and we imagine it is beyond the ability of Mr.
Murphy, to conceive of force without something that exerts
force, of intelligence without a being who is intelligent.
Indeed, Mr. Murphy concedes that "where there
are properties there must be a <i>substance</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and by substance,
he says, he understands "<i>underlying reality</i>."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
Unconscious intelligence, if there be such a thing, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
an attribute or quality inherent in some underlying substance.
But Mr. Murphy asserts "there is no scientific
basis for the old belief in a distinct <i>mental substance</i>"<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>&mdash;that
is, if we understand him aright, so far as finite
mind is concerned. On the other hand, he distinctly
affirms that this unconscious intelligence is not Divine intelligence.
The power and intelligence which work in the
world of matter and mind "are not the Divine power and
intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Unconscious intelligence, then, must be
an "endowment of vitalized matter;"<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and "life has its
origin in no secondary cause, but in the direct action of
creative power."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Now the question arises, What is matter?
On this point we must be careful not to misunderstand
or misrepresent Mr. Murphy. "Matter, whether
viewed from a metaphysical or from an inductive point
of view, is known only as a function of force, and can be
described only in terms of force. In other words, <i>the universe
is nothing but a manifestation of force</i>." And
now we ask, Of what force? "Force," says Mr. Murphy,
"is known to us by immediate consciousness as a function
of our own mind and will; that is to say, the mind, acting
in will, is conscious of itself as a force&mdash;and we are able
to conceive of force in no other way; the only conception
of force which we are able to frame is that of voluntary
force, or the exertion of will. <i>Either the force manifested
in the universe is the force of a Creative Will, or we
are able to form no conception of it whatever.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Can
there be any possibility of misunderstanding this language?
Matter itself is not an entity, not a <i>substance</i>;
it is a phenomenon, not a reality. Matter is "a function<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
of force." Force is a "fact of mind, and therefore spiritual."
Consequently "matter can only be conceived as
<i>spiritual</i>."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> And now let us recall the statement of Mr.
Murphy that there is no finite, created, underlying reality
for the phenomena of mind and will&mdash;"<i>no distinct mental
substance</i>." If we hold to this doctrine, then we must say
with Mr. Murphy again that "the powers of matter and
mind alike are the result and expression of a Living Will&mdash;and
if a Living Will, then also an Intelligent Will."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
The final and only conclusion is that God, "the Self-existent
Being," is the one only underlying reality or <i>substance</i>
in the universe; all the force in the universe is
"the force of the Creative Will," and all the intelligence
in the universe a modification of the Divine Thought.</p>

<p>This, however, is Pantheism, even according to that very
defective definition of Pantheism given by Mr. Murphy:
"Pantheism is the identification of the Divine power and
intelligence with the powers and intelligences that work in
the world of matter and mind."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Still, Mr. Murphy declares,
"I am not a Pantheist;" and we are bound to accept
his disclaimer&mdash;"the power and intelligence which work
in nature are not identical with the Divine power and intelligence."
Be it so; then there is power, and there is
intelligence in nature, which are not attributes of any reality,
and which do not inhere in any substance; and we
come round to the original difficulty of conceiving of an
attribute apart from a subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>The reader can not have failed to see that Mr. Murphy
has been leading us round a vicious circle. "Force is a
function of matter, and matter is a function of force."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
"Matter is only explicable as a function of force, force
only explicable as a function of conscious mind,"<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and
mind is "one of the functions of matter."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> "It is perfectly
certain," says Mr. Murphy, "that inductive psychology
gives no hint of any mental <i>substance</i> as distinguished
from the material substance of the brain."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> But the
material substance of the brain after all is not material;
"matter can only be conceived as <i>spiritual</i>"<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>&mdash;that is, as
<i>force</i>. There is no underlying reality which men call
"matter," and there is no underlying reality which men
call "spirit." Matter is spirit, spirit is matter; but in reality
neither the one nor the other has any substantial reality.
If all finite existences are but modes of the Infinite Being,
we have a consistent Pantheism at any rate. But if all
finite existences are simply phenomena without any underlying
reality, then "perception is a dream, and my existence
the dream of that dream."</p>

<p>Thirdly, the hypothesis of an "<i>unconscious intelligence</i>,"
distinct from the Supreme Intelligence, which does "the
drudgery of Providence," and to which the defects and
disorders and "immoralities" of nature are ascribed, is
neither adequate nor satisfactory.</p>

<p>The conceit of Cudworth that it is unbecoming the
Divine Majesty to be immediately concerned in every
thing that takes place in nature is scarcely worthy of consideration:
"If it were not congruous in respect of the
state and majesty of Xerxes, the king of Persia, that he
should condescend to do all the meanest offices himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
much less can this be thought decorous in respect of
God."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Human conceptions of what is great or small, dignified
or indecorous, are merely relative conceptions which vary
with our knowledge, culture, and taste; but&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is no great and no small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the soul that maketh all."&mdash;<i>Emerson</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For the Creator of all things an atom is an ample field
in which to display the resources of his omnipotence.
The more the microscope and spectroscope reveal of the
"infinitely little," the more do we see of the greatness and
glory of God. So of men's conceptions of what is dignified
or indecorous; it may be that, in a land and an age
where labor is held in contempt, it becomes the state of an
Eastern monarch that he should live in voluptuous ease,
but the followers of Him who said, "My Father worketh
hitherto, and I work," have learned to believe in the dignity
of labor, and to regard all true work as divine. An imperfect
human ruler can not do every thing, therefore he
must employ agents and ministers; the Omnipotent Ruler
of the universe can do all things, and needs no subordinate
ministry. A finite mind can not know every thing, and
often staggers beneath the burden of its limited acquisitions;
the Infinite Mind <i>must</i> know all things, and can
not be perplexed amid the boundless profusion of its own
creations. It is only a childish impotence or a barbaric
vanity which sees the need of supplementary agencies to
add to the splendor and efficiency of the Divine government
of the world. "Are not two sparrows sold for a
farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground
without your Father." "The very hairs of your head are
all numbered." Such views exalt rather than diminish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
our reverence for the majesty of God. But there is neither
congruity nor dignity in the hypothesis that God has associated
with Himself an agent which is "<i>unconscious</i>,"
whose action He must direct,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> and whose "shortcomings
and defects" He must supply.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Dr. Mosheim, the annotator
of Cudworth's "Intellectual System," pertinently
remarks: "That master has enough to do who must continually
take care that the servants he employs, unskillful
and devoid of reason, do not err; who must preside
over the actions of his agents, and continually remedy the
defects and mischiefs they occasion.... That master is
the happier man who possesses the power of conducting
his own affairs, who can do all things himself, and needs
no servants whatever." But if subordinate agents are
needed, or if it please the Supreme Being to employ them,
the presumption is certainly in favor of rational conscious
agents, rather than blind unconscious forces which can
neither conceive a purpose nor adapt means to secure it.
If we must have formative agents, we prefer the "junior
divinities" of Plato or the "higher intelligences" of Mr.
Wallace.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>But even admitting there are "defects, deformities, and
superfluities" in nature, we are at a loss to conceive how
the hypothesis of an "unconscious intelligence," working
necessarily, removes the blame (if there be any blame)
from the Author of nature. Does not every theist believe
that the Creator of matter "saw and knew every purpose
which every particle and atom of matter should subserve
in all suns and systems, and through all coming æons of
time?" Must not that Intelligent Will, which is the fount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ain-head
of all the force that sweeps like a tide of life
through the universe, have known every form of energy
which could result therefrom, and foreseen all the possible
effects which would arise from the composition of any and
all systems of forces? Did not He who created this supposed
"organizing force," who ordained all its laws, and
who directs and controls all its actions, know with mathematical
precision every consequence which could possibly
arise from its prearranged and necessitated adaptations?
If God is the creator of this unconscious, necessitated
"plastic nature," if He always observes what it does, if He
directs and overrules it, if He supplies some of its defects
and corrects most of its mistakes, must not He be regarded
as the real cause of all things which, in popular language,
are said to be done by nature? If we believe with Mr.
Murphy that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nature is but the name for an effect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose cause is God,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we shall find no relief from the difficulties and mysteries
of Divine providence by interposing between the first creative
volition and the last phenomenal result a series of
secondary causes which are themselves only effects of the
primal creative act. It were better far to leave the mystery
untouched, and take refuge in faith; better to confess
the difficulties are insoluble, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Still trust that God is love indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And love Creation's final law;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Though nature, red in tooth and claw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With ravin, shrieks against our creed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are brought finally to the question whether, in reality,
there is any thing defective or any thing superfluous
in the normal products of organic nature? or, in other
words, whether the Author of nature has made any thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
inadequate to its purpose, or which fulfills no purpose whatever?
We venture to suggest that inductive science is not
in possession either of the facts or the principles which are
necessary to a correct judgment. To be competent to
deal with this question, science should not only know all
the purposes which may be fulfilled by a single organism,
but also the ultimate purpose which is subserved by the
wondrous play of all the means and relative ends which
constitute the entire cosmos. Far be it from us to depreciate
the achievements or dare to set limits to the possibilities
of inductive science. But, assuredly, the most enthusiastic
scientist will admit that, compared with the vastness
and complexity of natural phenomena, human knowledge
is exceedingly limited and very imperfect. As to
the final purpose of creation&mdash;the ultimate end of the
Creator in the existence of the universe&mdash;modern science
does not even claim to have an opinion.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> With no knowledge
of the ultimate purpose of creation, with a limited
acquaintance with the general plan of the universe, with
an imperfect knowledge of the reasons and ends of individual
existences, it seems little less than impertinence for
science to sit in judgment on the works of God, and unceremoniously
condemn this as defective and that as unnecessary.
As Baden Powell observes, "How can we undertake
to affirm, amid all the possibilities of things of which
we confessedly know so little, that a thousand ends and
purposes may not be answered, because we can trace none,
or even imagine none, which seem to our short-sighted
faculties to be answered."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> In view of the fact that hitherto
the belief in "purpose" or "final cause" has been
the guiding light of science, and the further fact that sci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>ence
is every day making new discoveries as to the utility
of existences and organs of which before we were ignorant,
scientific men might learn a profitable lesson, and
manifest less "audacity."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Meantime we shall be content
with the assurances of Scripture that "the works of God
are <i>perfect</i>," and that "He hath made nothing <i>in vain</i>."</p>


<p>We may now gather up the several threads of thought
which run through this essay, and state our final conclusions:</p>

<p>1. Matter is the merely passive or statical condition for
the action of force.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The most fundamental condition or
characteristic of matter, "perhaps its only true indication,
is <i>inertia</i>."<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> "All that we can affirm of it is that it is the
<i>recipient</i> of impulse and of Energy."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> All the attempts
which have been made to reduce matter to a function or
phenomenon of force have ended in failure. Motion necessarily
implies a <i>something</i> which is moved by the action of
force. Even that most wonderful and subtile of all "modes
of motion"&mdash;light&mdash;necessarily implies an entity which is
moved. "The magnetic rotation of the plane of polarized
light, discovered by Faraday, implies an <i>actual</i> rotatory
motion of something." "The seeing intellect," says Mr.
Tyndall, "when properly focused, must realize this conception
at last." Matter must consist of ultimate continuous
atoms or molecules possessing inertia and capable of being
moved in space. By virtue of its extension and inertia it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
can intercept force, transform force into energy, and transmit
energy. The various forms of energy (heat, light, electricity,
magnetism, etc.) are transformations of force resulting
directly or indirectly from the interception of force by
inert matter, and "all the phenomena of material nature
result from the action of force <i>upon</i> matter."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> "Matter,"
says M. Claude Bernard, "does not generate the phenomena
which it manifests. It is only the substratum, and does
absolutely nothing but give to phenomena the conditions
of its manifestation."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>2. Force is that which originates or tends to originate
motion, or changes or tends to change the state of a body
with regard to motion. It is not and can not be a property
of matter. The doctrine that force is an attribute of
matter is disproved by the fact of inertia. Inert matter
can have no spontaneous power&mdash;it can not change its own
state of motion or rest. Neither is motion capable <i>per se</i>
of producing motion. It is a fundamental axiom of natural
philosophy that motion can not be generated by motion
itself, any more than by the negation of motion. Inertness
and exertion, passivity and activity, are contradictory
attributes, and can not be affirmed of the same subject.
To say that matter is inert, and at the same time that it
can exert force, is to violate the law of non-contradiction
to the uttermost.</p>

<p>Force is an attribute of mind or spirit, and of mind or
spirit alone. Spirit-force is the only force in the universe.
It is a doctrine as old as the hills that mind is the first
cause of motion. Νοῦς μὲν ἀρχὴν
κινησέως.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> It is a doc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>trine
toward which all modern science tends with remarkable
unanimity that all motion is the product of mind;
and, though continued and transformed and transmitted
through various means, it never commences except in a
volition either of the Supreme Mind or of a created mind.
"The deep-seated instincts of humanity and the profoundest
researches of philosophy alike point to <i>Mind as the one
and only source of power</i>."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> "The conception of force
as the originator of motion in matter, without bodily contact
or the intervention of any intermedium, is essential to
the right interpretation of physical phenomena;... its exertion
makes itself manifest to our personal consciousness
by the peculiar sensation of <i>effort</i>;... and it [force] affords
a point of contact, a connecting link between the two
great departments of being&mdash;between mind and matter&mdash;the
one as its <i>originator</i>, the other as its <i>recipient</i>."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>3. All the forms of energy manifested in the universe
are only transformations of the one omnipresent force issuing
from the one fountain-head of power&mdash;<i>the Divine
Will</i>. The final disclosure of modern science is the convertibility
and homogeneity of all forms of physical energy&mdash;"a
dynamical self-identification masked by transmigration."
Of this wonderful transformation of energy many
striking illustrations may be given; we select the following
from the "Lecture Notes" of Dr. A. F. Mayer (p. 64):
"The heat developed by the 'falling force' of a weight
striking the terminals of a compound thermal battery
(formed by pieces of iron and German-silver wire twisted
together at alternate ends) caused a current of electricity
through the wire which, being conducted through a helix,
magnetized a needle (which then attracted iron particles),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
caused light to appear in a portion of the circuit formed
of Wollaston's fine wire, decomposed iodide of potassium,
and finally moved the needles of a galvanometer."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Here
we have visible kinetic energy transformed into sensible
heat, then absorbed heat converted into electricity, then
electricity transformed into magnetism, also into light, and
still further into the energy of chemical separation, while
some portion of it returns to the form of visible energy of
motion. Of course, some of the energy is dissipated in the
form of radiance (radiant light and heat), but no energy is
either created or destroyed. All the various forms of energy
are thus reducible to <i>unity</i>; they are one force transformed
by mechanical arrangements. "Electricity and
magnetism, heat and light, muscular energy and chemical
action, motion and mechanical work, are only different
forms of one and the same power.... Moreover, chemical
union of the elements of matter, the attraction of gravitation
in all the bodies of the universe, are but varied forms
of this universal motive force."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> If it be asked, What
is that one form of force which is to be taken as the type
of all the rest? the explicit answer of the first scientists of
the age is, "Force must be regarded as the direct expression
of that mental state which we call <i>Will</i>. All force
is of one type, and that type is mind."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> This is conceded
even by Herbert Spencer: "The force by which we ourselves
produce changes, and which serves to symbolize the
cause of changes in general, is the final disclosure of analy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>sis."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
The whole conception is summed up in one comprehensive
statement by Professor Norton, of Yale College:
"I regard the primary force of repulsion as incessantly
outstreaming in every direction from every ethereal atom
(which is incessantly renewed), and as it spreads outward
ever tending toward evanescence on each radiating line by
the mere result of its own expansion&mdash;<i>a perpetual stream
of force flowing from the Infinite Source of all power</i>,
vanishing ultimately by diffusion in the infinite expanse of
the universe. It breaks incessantly against the atoms of
bodies, and so furnishes the secondary streams of force that
maintain the constitution and determine the phenomena of
the material universe."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Force, then, is the act of the immanent
Deity, who puts forth unceasingly from every point
in the realm of space his creative and sustaining power.</p>

<p>4. All the phenomena of molecular life (bioplasmic phenomena)
are the result of the immediate presence and direct
agency of God.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>This is the doctrine which must finally be accepted,
whether vitality be regarded as a mode of energy&mdash;a transformation
of chemico-physical forces&mdash;or as a distinct and
special force. Dr. Carpenter has long held that the physical
and vital forces are mutually convertible, but he regards
both as the result of the direct action of the Deity.
"Believing that all force which does not emanate from the
will of created sentient beings <i>directly and immediately
proceeds from the will of the Omnipotent and Omnipresent
Creator</i>; and looking on the (what we are accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
to call) physical forces as so many <i>modi operandi</i> of one
and the same agency, the creative and sustaining will of
the Deity, I do not feel the validity of the objections urged
against the idea of the absolute metamorphosis or conversion
of forces."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Inasmuch, however, as the advocates of
this theory have failed to establish either a <i>quantitative</i> or
a <i>qualitative</i> relation between the vital and physical forces,
but, on the contrary, the most exact and careful biological
researches show them to be inconvertible and antagonistic,
we are constrained still to hold the doctrine maintained by
Dr. Beale.</p>

<p>The ancient doctrine that "Life is the cause, and not the
consequence of organization,"<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> still maintains its ground
against all assaults. Harvey's famous maxim, <i>Omne vivum
ex ovo</i>&mdash;as amended by Charles Robin, <i>Omne vivum ex
vivo</i>&mdash;stands yet unrefuted; and, as Sir William Thomson
remarked in his inaugural address before the British Association
of Science, "This seems to me as sure a teaching of
science as the law of gravitation. I confess to being deeply
impressed by the evidence put before us by Professor
Huxley, and I am ready to adopt it as an article of scientific
faith&mdash;true through all space and all time&mdash;that <i>life
proceeds from life, and nothing but life</i>."<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Life has its
origin in no secondary cause, but in the immediate presence
and direct action of the Deity. God is the author
and giver of Life&mdash;the constant sustainer of all vitality;
"in Him we live and move and are."</p>

<p>The final conclusion to be drawn from these propositions
is that God is not simply the <i>transitive</i> but the <i>immanent</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
cause of the universe. He is in nature, not merely as a
<i>regulative</i> principle impressing laws upon matter, but as
a <i>constitutive</i> principle, the ever-present source and ever-operating
cause of all its phenomena. If by the term
nature we understand the totality of necessary and uniform
phenomena, God is the immediate cause of all uniform
and necessary phenomena. If by nature we understand
the varied forms of energy which underlie the phenomena,
and are manifested in the phenomena, these forms
of energy are but various modes in which the omnipresent
power of God reveals itself. God is immanent in matter,
and his ceaseless energy produces all the phenomena of
nature. Nature is more than matter: it is matter swayed
by Divine power, and organized and animated by the Divine
life.</p>

<p>But the question may be here raised, Is not this identification
of the dynamical life of the universe with God,
Pantheism? We answer in the language of James Martineau:
"It certainly would be so if we also turned the
proposition round and identified God with no more than
the life of the universe, and treated the two terms as for
all purposes interchangeable. If in affirming the Divine
<i>immanency</i> in nature we deny the Divine <i>transcendency</i>
beyond nature, and pay our worship to the aggregate of all
its powers, the law of its laws, the unity of its organism,...
then undoubtedly we do pass from part to whole, and rest
in a dream of future science instead of emerging into immediate
religion."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The theory which represents the Deity
as the transitive cause of the universe&mdash;a Δημιουργός
mechanically fashioning the materials supplied to his hands,
and then leaving it to the working of its own inherent
forces&mdash;is rank Deism. The hypothesis which regards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Deity as <i>no more</i> than the dynamical life of the universe&mdash;an
informing and organizing soul associated with matter&mdash;is
naked Hylozoism. The theory that reduces all existence,
material and mental, to phenomenal manifestations
of one eternal self-existent substance which evolves itself
according to an inward law of necessity, and which is elusively
called God, is Pantheism. But the doctrine which
embraces the two conceptions of <i>transcendence</i> and <i>immanence</i>,
and while it teaches the immanence of God in matter,
proclaims the infinite distinctness in essence between
matter and God, and the infinite omnipresence of a personal
God above and beyond the limitations of matter, is
Christian Theism.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>And now, in conclusion, may we not say that this dictum
of faith that the universe exists only in virtue of the continued
Will of its Creator, is coming more and more to be
recognized as a scientific fact. The will of God is the one
primal force which streams forth in ever-recurring impulses
with an immeasurable rapidity at every point in
space&mdash;an incessant pulse-beat of the Infinite Life.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The
disposition and collocations of matter are simply the conditions
necessary to the manifestation of this primal force.
The chemical atom, "already quite a complex little world,"<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
is a mechanism for the interception, transformation, and
transmission of force. All the varied forms of energy are
but secondary and derivative streams of force&mdash;forms of
energy which are conceivable only as effects, and which
by mere accommodation we may be permitted to call
"causes," yet with this specific reservation that "they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
are not vicegerents outside of the Divine Will, but are
held within the Divine Will." "The word '<i>cause</i>' may
be used in a secondary and concrete sense as meaning antecedent
forces, yet in an abstract sense it is totally inapplicable;
we can not predicate of any physical agent that
it is abstractedly the cause of another; and if, for the sake
of convenience, the language of secondary causation be
permissible, it should only be with reference to the special
phenomena referred to, as it can never be generalized."
"The common error, if I am right in supposing it to be
such, consists in the abstraction of cause, and in supposing
in each case a general secondary cause&mdash;a something
which is not the First Cause, but which, if we examine it
carefully, <i>must have all the attributes of a first cause, and
an existence independent of and dominant over matter</i>."

THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD IN HUMAN HISTORY.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"Les nations sont régies par les mêmes lois que les individus."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Laurent.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>From the central and fundamental truth that God is
the Creator and Conservator of the universe, Christian
theology advances to the still more practical truth that
He determines and presides over the development of the
human race, leading it toward a foreseen and predestinated
goal.</p>

<p>This is the natural and logical order of thought. If
nature and man were created and are still conserved by
an intelligent power, there must be some reason or end
for which they exist; for intelligent power can only be
conceived as a power which works toward ends. The existence
of the world and of man being given, the question
concerning the purpose or end for which they exist becomes
unavoidable and necessary; and though physical
science may proclaim "its inability to disclose the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
purpose of creation," and speak contemptuously of all
such inquiries, it does not by any means follow that Christian
doctrine can furnish no satisfactory answer to this
inevitable question. As the reference of the dependent
universe to the efficient ground of its existence gives the
concepts of <i>Creation</i> and <i>Conservation</i> with which the
idea of power is pre-eminently associated, so the reference
of the same to the ultimate reason of its existence
gives the concepts of <i>Providence</i> and <i>Moral Government</i>
with which the idea of all-wise love is immediately correlated.</p>

<p>The Christian doctrine of Providence in human history
is succinctly stated in the words of St. Paul: "God hath
made of one blood all the nations of mankind to dwell
upon the face of the whole earth, and ordained to each
the appointed times of their existence and the bounds of
their habitation, that they should seek after, and indeed
feel after, and find the Lord." He has endowed man
with intelligence and freedom by which he may achieve
the conquest of nature, and be able to maintain his existence
and ascendency in every part of the habitable globe.
A new and subtile force appears in the arena of nature,
which is superior to nature, which can control and regulate
its action, and subordinate the forces of nature to the
higher purposes and needs of spiritual and moral being.
By travel and observation, by reasoning and invention, by
interchange of ideas and products, man may continually
enlarge the sphere of his knowledge, and multiply the
means of improvement and happiness.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> God has also
"determined beforehand the <i>time</i> of each nation's exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ence,
and the geographical <i>boundaries</i> of their habitation."
Divine providence has decreed and presided over the dispersions
and migrations of the human race, and in the
plan of history fixed the time when and the people by
which each continent and island shall be inhabited. And
the ultimate purpose of this providential arrangement and
supervision is that men "may seek God, and feel after and
really find Him," who for all dependent rational existence
is the chief good.</p>

<p>This, then, is the explicit teaching of Christian theology:
The appearance of rational existence on the earth
constitutes a distinct creative epoch; the final cause of all
rational existence is to know God, consciously to feel after
and find Him; and the whole of God's action upon humanity
has been an inspiration, guidance, and education
toward this end. <i>The progress of the human race, the
course of human history, is therefore a revelation of the
Providence of God.</i></p>

<p>"The consideration of nature," says Niebuhr, "shows
an inherent intelligence, which may be also considered
as coherent in nature; so does history, on a hundred occasions,
show an intelligence distinct from nature which
conducts and determines those things which may seem to
us accidental; and it is not true that history weakens our
belief in Divine providence. History is, of all kinds of
knowledge, the one which tends most decidedly to that
belief."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> "History," observes Richter, "has, like nature,
the highest value (if studied philosophically) in so far
as we by means of it, as by means of nature, can divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and read the Infinite Spirit who, with nature and history
as with letters, legibly writes to us. He who finds a God
in the physical world will also find one in the moral world&mdash;which
is history. Nature forces on our hearts a Creator;
history, a Providence." To the student of history it becomes
apparent that the hand of God has been guiding
humanity toward the fulfillment of its destiny. God has
presided over the development of human society and government.
Throughout the ages He has been the Educator
of the race&mdash;leading, instructing, chastening, and blessing
the nations. "Man holds relations to God not merely at
the moment of creation; he does not cease to be in connection
with his Creator through the endless duration of
his existence. The incessant action of God on man is
grace; the incessant action of God on humanity is providential
government."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> "History is the manifestation of
God's supervision of humanity, and the judgments of history
are the judgments of God."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>If we have here the true conception of history, if it is a
manifestation of Divine supervision, direction, and discipline,
then the question is at once legitimate and practical,
What is the end of this discipline? what is the foreseen and
predestinated goal toward which, through conflict and pain
and travail, Divine providence is leading the human race?</p>

<p>It must be conceded on all hands that the adequate
and final answer can only be given by that Divine prescience
which "sees the end from the beginning." The
study of the past and of the present moral and religious
phenomena of the world may afford to the philosophic
mind some prevision of the future, but it is obvious that
revelation alone can supply the principles which must con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>stitute
the light of history&mdash;the light in which even its
darkest chapters may be interpreted, and its true philosophy
evolved.</p>

<p>The general answer which speculative thought has furnished
to this question is that the goal of history is <i>the
highest perfection of humanity</i>. Aristotle clearly recognizes
that there must be an end or final cause of human
existence and action&mdash;a τέλειον τέλος (<i>summum bonum</i>),
or chief end.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> He therefore addresses himself to the inquiry,
What is the chief good, or highest end of man?
The conclusion which he reaches is, that it is the absolute
satisfaction of his whole nature&mdash;that which men have
agreed to call <i>happiness</i>. This happiness, however, is not
mere sensual pleasure. The brute shares this in common
with man, therefore it can not constitute the happiness of
man. Human happiness must express the <i>completeness</i> of
rational existence, or, as he expresses it, "a perfect practical
activity in a perfect life."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> This "complete and perfect
life" is the complete satisfaction of our rational nature.
It is the realization of the Divine in man, and constitutes
the absolute and all-sufficient good.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> A good action
is thus "an end in itself," inasmuch as it tends to secure
the <i>perfection</i> of our nature.</p>

<p>The human mind can not, however, rest in the general
and vague idea of perfection; we are therefore pressed
with the further question, In what does the highest perfection
of humanity consist? by what standard are we to
judge of this perfection? what is the <i>ideal</i> toward which
the progress of humanity may be presumed to tend, and
which we hope it will ultimately attain? The following
considerations may furnish the answer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That ideal must be the same for the race as for the
individual, the same for the nation as for the man. For,
on the one hand, society exists for the sake of the individual,
and it is only in society that individual existences
can be preserved, developed, and perfected; on the other
hand, national character is but the expression of the collective
or average character of the individual citizens.</p>

<p>In seeking for the ideal of individual perfection, we
must take account of all the capacities, powers, and relations
of man. We must have in view, not simply his
physical and intellectual, but also his moral and religious
nature. We must think of the relation in which he stands
to his fellow-beings and to his God, as well as the relation
in which he stands to himself&mdash;that is, to the liberty
and intelligence which are in him, and which he must develop.
Now no man can be said to be complete, to be
<i>perfect</i>, no man can be said to have reached his τέλος, or
end, until he has developed in his thought and realized in
his life the idea of the useful, the true, the just, the good,
the pure, the Divine. Loyalty to God and the truth, justice
and charity toward men, self-control and purity of
mind, intellectual discipline and cultivated taste&mdash;these are
the characteristics of the perfect man. Judged from the
Christian stand-point, he is the perfect man who has attained
to that ideal of moral and spiritual excellence which
was exhibited in the human life of Christ, that grand embodiment
of all that is "pure and true and just and lovely
and of good report." The realization of this ideal in the
collective life of humanity must be the goal of history.</p>

<p>2. Further light is shed upon this problem by the consideration
of the Christian idea of God. The gravitating
point of Christian theology is found in the Divine declaration,
"<i>God is Love</i>" (1 John iv. 8, 16). This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
most fundamental revelation of the Divine nature, so that
nothing can pertain to his perfections or his works which
is not ultimately resolvable into love. "If ever the idea
of Divine justice shall obtain consistency [in our systems
of theology], it must be in general through the relation of
infinite holy love to the spontaneous and self-determining
capacity of the personal being, or the relation of Divine
perfection to the existence of the economy in the universe."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
The fact that God creates worlds and gives birth
to personal existences is not grounded in his omnipotence,
but in his love. Divine love is the determinative principle
of Divine efficiency&mdash;the final cause or ultimate reason
of all existence. Creation must therefore be conceived
as the free self-communication of God, who is Himself
eternally self-complete and self-sufficient, but who, from
love alone, wills that other intelligences shall have existence
who can "know God," and in fellowship with Him
attain that fullness and fruition of being which is called
"Eternal Life."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> If, then, the Divine mind has always
had this end in view&mdash;the perfection and blessedness of
personal being in fellowship with Himself&mdash;it must be regarded
by us as the consummation toward which his providence
is leading humanity.</p>

<p>3. The explicit declarations of Scripture are in perfect
accord with these inferences drawn from the nature of
man and the idea of God. We learn from the words of
St. Paul that the aim of Divine providence is to lead the
race to the practical recognition of the personal dignity of
man as "the offspring of God;" to the practical recognition
of the universal brotherhood of man, as "of one
blood," with equal rights to place, provision, and free self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>-development
in "every part of the earth;" finally, to the
practical recognition of our relation to God as his dependent
creatures, in fellowship with whom we have eternal
life.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> God's great end in the whole course and discipline
of providence is to unite all men in bonds of mutual affection
and aid, and to unite the race to Himself in bonds of
loyalty and love. Then "whatsoever things are true and
pure and honest and lovely and of good report" will be
revered and practiced among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>These views of Divine providence can scarcely be said
to have had any place or any recognition in the ancient
schools of philosophy. The Stoics taught that an invincible
necessity rules in the realm of history as well as in the
field of nature, to which God and man are equally subject.
"God is the reason of the world (τοῦ παντὸς τοῦ λόγου);
the laws of the world are as necessary as the laws of
eternal reason. This necessity is at once <i>fate</i> (εἱμαρμένη),
and the <i>providence</i> (πρόνοια) which governs all things."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
The Epicureans reduced all existence to the plane of mere
physical nature, and represented humanity as a development
from the lower forms of life by the agency of blind,
unconscious force. If they recognized the existence of
any god or gods, they removed them far away from all
intercourse with humanity, and all supervision of or concern
in human affairs. "They admitted their existence
in words," says Cicero, "but denied it in act." These two
forms of error are combined by the modern deniers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
providence. Human society, languages, laws, institutions,
arts, sciences, are all the products of matter and force.
The succession of events, the progress of civilization, and
the religious phenomena of the world, have not been
determined by an intelligent Will, or presided over by a
conscious Personality. In the last analysis, matter is resolved
into a function of force, and a process of necessary
evolution, which has no design and no final purpose,
is substituted for Divine providence. The ultimate destination
of the world and humanity is unknown, or, if conjecture
is permissible, is chaos and death.</p>

<p>In opposition to these cold and cheerless speculations
Christianity affirms the doctrine of Divine providence in
human history.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>By Providence we understand intelligent <i>forethought</i>
and timely <i>provision</i> for all contingencies. The term
supposes a precognized <i>plan</i>, a constant supervision of
its development, and the control and subordination of
all finite powers and agencies in order to its completion.
From nature, strictly considered as the empire of mechanical
necessity, nothing can proceed but that which
is posited in it by the immediate act of God; and consequently,
considered apart from man, there can be no
contingency, and, properly speaking, no providence in this
sphere. The existence of mere nature, however, can not
be regarded as an end in itself. The whole interest and
significance of nature is found in the conception that it exists
as a means for a higher end. As matter is simply the
condition for the manifestation of force, as the physical
forces are subordinated to the vital force, and the vital is
subordinated to the mental, so is it a legitimate assumption,
which we shall justify in the sequel, that all these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
subordinated to the <i>moral</i> and <i>spiritual</i>. It is only in
the sphere of spiritual being&mdash;that is, of self-conscious and
self-determined being&mdash;and in the <i>relation of nature to
spiritual being</i>, that contingency can arise and providence
find place.</p>

<p>The uniform teaching of Scripture is that human history
is the special field of Divine providence. In fact, the
historic portions of the Bible are nothing else than a record
of the control and direction and subordination of human
agencies, and of external physical conditions in their
relation to personal beings, by the hand of God. This
primitive revelation throws light upon the cradle of human
civilization. It points to a period when man, at
his departure from the hand of God, received those intellectual,
moral, and spiritual endowments which raise
him in the scale of being immeasurably above the animal
creation, and fit him for a progress, a development to
which no conceivable limits can be assigned.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
is the history of Divine providence from that signal
commencement to the planting of the Christian Church,
where we can clearly see all the lines along which the
race advanced, converging upon "the Kingdom of God."
It is a history of Divine interposition in human affairs,
and of supernatural guidance toward a higher development
and a nobler destiny. Indeed, to the eye of the observant
and conscientious student of all history, whether
secular or ecclesiastical, there are undeniable evidences of
the presence of Intelligence, disposing and collocating the
conditions of human progress, and directing humanity toward
a nobler civilization.</p>

<p>Considering the earth in its relation to man, we must
recognize the providence of God in the physical universe.
The earth was unquestionably made for man. It was created,
and has been especially adapted to be the theatre of
human history. This is the doctrine of Scripture (Gen.
i. 28-31; Psa. cxv. 16)&mdash;I believe it is also the doctrine
of science. The geological changes through which the
earth has passed indicate "a process of preparation" for
the inhabitation of man. This process of preparation is
fully recognized by Agassiz. "There has been," he says,
"a manifest progress in the succession of beings on the
surface of the globe. This progress consists in an increasing
similarity to the living fauna, and, among the vertebrates
especially, in the increasing resemblance to man.
But this connection is not the consequence of a direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
lineage between the faunas of different ages. The fishes
of the Palæozoic are in no respect the ancestors of the
reptiles of the Secondary age, nor does man descend from
the mammals of the Tertiary age. The link by which
they are connected is of an immaterial nature, and their
connection is to be sought in the thought of the Creator
Himself, whose <i>aim</i> in forming the earth, in allowing it
to pass through the successive changes which Geology has
pointed out, and in creating successively all the different
types of animals which have passed away, was to introduce
man upon the surface of the globe. Man is the end
toward which all the animal creation has tended."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The
language of Prof. Owen is equally explicit: "The recognition
of an ideal exemplar in the vertebrated animals
proves that the knowledge of such a being as man existed
before man appeared; for the Divine Mind which planned
the archetype also foresaw all its modifications. The
archetype idea was manifested in the flesh long prior to
the existence of those animal species that actually exemplify
it."<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> "Of the nature of the creative acts by which
the successive races of animals were called into being, we
are ignorant. But this we know, that as the evidence of
unity of plan testifies to the oneness of the Creator, so the
modifications of the plan for different modes of existence
illustrate the benevolence of the Designer. Those structures,
moreover, which are at present incomprehensible as
adaptations to a special end, are made comprehensible on
a higher principle, and a <i>final purpose</i> is gained in relation
to human intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> That these views are still
held by Prof. Owen is evident from his remarks in the
fortieth chapter of his "Anatomy of the Vertebrates:"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
"Of all the quadrupedal servants of man, none have
proved of more value to him, in peace or war, than the
horse; none have co-operated with the advanced races
more influentially in man's destined mastery over the
earth and its lower denizens.... I believe the horse to
have been predestinated and prepared for man. It may
be a weakness; but, if so, it is a glorious one, to discern,
however dimly, across our finite prison-wall, evidence of
'the Divinity that shapes our ends,' abuse the means as
we may."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Long before the appearance of man upon the earth, the
providence of God laid up in its strata those vast treasures
of granite, sandstone, lime, marble, coal, salt, petroleum,
and the various metals, the product of a long succession
of ages and revolutions, thus making an inexhaustible provision
for the necessities of man, and furnishing ample resources
for the development of his genius and skill.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> In
the vegetable life which appeared on the globe immediately
prior to and contemporaneous with the advent of man,
we can recognize a providential arrangement made for
man. In the flora of the Palæozoic and Secondary periods
we can not fail to observe the absence of all those plants
which are adapted for human food. Even in the Tertiary
epoch, which immediately precedes the Adamic or human
period, so far as Geology reveals, there were few or no
plants yielding the appropriate supplies for the sustentation
of man. There are few indications of any of those vegetables
from which man may derive food and valuable fibre,
and, in a word, of species which support and clothe by far
the larger portion of the human race. "Scarcely any
grasses appear in the list of extinct vegetation, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
is reason to believe that the principal cereals which are
characteristic of the human period&mdash;as barley, wheat, oats,
rye, millet, Indian corn, and rice"&mdash;had no existence.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
When the fullness of time was come, and all things
were ready for the reception of man, then God called
him into being, and invested him with dominion over
nature.</p>

<p>Physical geography also indicates, not only a state of
preparation for man, but also a special adaptation of the
fixed forms of the earth's surface for securing the perfect
development of man according to the Divine ideal. And
as the land which man inhabits, the food he eats, the air
he breathes, the mountains and rivers and seas which are
his neighbors, the skies that overshadow him, the diversities
of climate to which he is subject, and indeed all physical
conditions, exert a powerful influence upon his tastes,
pursuits, habits, and character&mdash;we may presume that not
only are all these conditions predetermined by God, but
continually under his control and supervision.</p>

<p>The distribution of terrestrial areas&mdash;the continents, islands,
and seas; the disposition of the climate, soil, and
vegetation, apparently accidental, have played an important
part in the moral history of our race. There is a
close relation between nature and history, between the
earth and man. The soul of man is distinct from, but not
totally independent of the body and of external physical
conditions. To deny this would be to reject all the lessons
of experience. The relation of man to nature is not,
however, a relation of cause and effect, but, as Cousin
remarks, "Man and nature are two great effects which,
coming from the <i>same</i> cause, bear the same characteristics,
so that the earth and he who inhabits it, man and nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
are in perfect harmony."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> "A living God," says Ritter,
"is at the head of the physical and moral world."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> The
earth was created for man, not simply to be a dwelling-place,
but a <i>school-house</i><a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>&mdash;made to be a theatre for the
education, the development, and the perfection of the human
race. And as the moral and intellectual culture of
the child is materially affected by the physical conditions
with which he is surrounded, and as these are consequently
the subject of care and forethought on the part of the
intelligent and prudent parent and teacher, so the external
physical conditions of a nation exert a powerful influence
on its intellectual and moral development, and therefore
must be presumed to be the subject of forethought and
providence on the part of God, "the Father of the families
of all the earth." God has superintended the peopling
of the earth, the dispersions and migrations of nations,
guiding the footsteps of the "covenant, educating, and
missionary nations" to those countries best adapted to
their highest development. In a word, He has ordained
the progress of empire and the course of civilization.</p>

<p>Thus nature and history are the two great factors of
Divine providence; in their relations and harmonies we
have a revelation of the purposes and plans of God.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>That geographical conditions do exert a powerful influence
on the character of nations can not be denied. "The
bodily constitution of a people, their temperament, modes
of life, habitations, customs, languages, and even religious
opinions have been formed or modified under the influence
of that magic circle of nature which surrounds them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
which so powerfully affects what is individual in national
character." So that, could we fully grasp all the characteristics
of a country&mdash;its position, configuration, climate,
scenery, and natural products&mdash;we could, with tolerable accuracy,
determine what are the characteristics of the people
who inhabit it. We have discussed this topic at some
length in "Christianity and Greek Philosophy," and shall
here simply recall such of the general facts and principles
as may be needed for a clear understanding of the present
discussion.</p>

<p>1. <i>The habits and characteristics of the dwellers in the
Temperate Zone differ widely from those of the dwellers
in the Torrid Zone.</i> This is an obvious fact; and the
causes of this difference are equally obvious to the observant
mind. In the tropical regions the powers of vegetable
and animal life are stimulated to the highest degree, and
here nature displays her fullest energy, her greatest variety,
and her richest splendors. Excessive heat enfeebles and
enervates man. It induces lassitude, dreaminess, effeminacy,
and tempts to quietude and indolence. Where nature
pours her fullness into the lap of ease, forethought and
providence are little needed. Here is none of that struggle
for existence which awakens sagacity and develops industry.
Nothing calls man to that effort for the conquest
of nature by which the intellect is aroused and the reasoning
faculties are developed. Consequently the mere
life of the body, the powers of the physical nature of man,
overmaster the faculties of the mind. The instincts predominate
over the reason. Simple spontaneity of thought
is manifested, but little or no analytic reflection. Feeling,
imagination, sentiment, predominate over intellect,
reason, and science. In a temperate climate all is reversed.
The alternations of heat and cold render man more vigor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>ous,
and impart more physical tone. Where there is less
profusion and lavishment of nature's gifts, there is more
room and motive for industry. The change of seasons, and
an annual period of dormancy, demand forethought and
prudence. The preservation of life demands, not merely
physical toil, but some degree of contrivance, and, indeed,
the vigorous exertion of the intellectual powers.
And here, though nature is not prodigal of her gifts, she
grants to industry and skill something more than the bare
necessities of life. She allows man to lay up a store for
the future, and furnishes some leisure for the culture of
the mind. The active powers of man, his reason and judgment,
rule his instincts, and control, more or less, his appetites
and emotions. Here man becomes a careful observer
of events; he treasures up the results of experience,
compares one fact with another, notes their relations, and
makes new experiments to test his conclusions. Thus science
has its birth in the Temperate Zone.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>There is a marked difference between the mental
habits and modes of thought of the peoples who dwell in
the interior of an immense continent and those who dwell
on the margin of the sea.</i> Vast continents, unbroken by
lakes and inland seas, and extended plains where broad
deserts and high mountain ranges separate the populations,
are the seats of immobility. The inhabitants are isolated
from the rest of the world, and excluded from a stimulating
and profitable intercourse with the nations of the earth.
They have comparatively no navigation, their commerce is
limited to the bare necessities of life, and there are no inducements
to movement, to travel, and to enterprise. Society
is therefore stationary, as in China; the habits, manners,
and usages of social and civil life remain as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
were two thousand years ago. Infolded and imprisoned
within the overwhelming vastness and illimitable sway of
nature, man is almost unconscious of his freedom and personality.
He surrenders himself to the disposal of a mysterious
"fate," and yields readily to the absolute control
of rulers who are regarded as of supernatural origin and
endowed with superhuman powers. The forms of government
remain unchanged from age to age, and the state is
the reign of fixed and inexorable laws&mdash;"The laws of the
Medes and Persians are unalterable." The rights of the
person are scarcely recognized, and the individual is lost
in the mass.</p>

<p>Extended border-lands on the margin of great rivers
and inland seas are, on the contrary, the theatre of movement,
activity, and life. Here man is set free from the
bondage imposed by the overpowering magnitude and
vastness of continental and oceanic forms. Here industry
is not stationary, but progressive; and commerce thrives
because the rivers and inland seas furnish the means of
easy transit, and the opportunity for a free interchange of
commodities. Along with the exchange of commodities
there will be an exchange of ideas, because ideas flow
along the channels of commerce. Here also the arts will
be cultivated, first for purposes of gain, and subsequently
for the gratification of taste. And, where there is freedom
of movement, where there is creative industry, where nature
is subjugated by man, the idea of personal liberty will
be developed, and the rights of the individual will be regarded.
These ideas of personal liberty and rights will
become incorporated with the laws and institutions of society,
and the government will tend toward a democracy.
Finally, this freedom of movement and action will engender
freedom of thought. Reflection will commence, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
speculative and critical spirit will arise, and philosophy
will be born.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>There is also an acknowledged difference between the
mental character of the inhabitants of a bright and sunny
climate who breathe an elastic atmosphere, and are surrounded
by the most inspiring scenery, and that of the
people who dwell under a gray and sombre sky, and daily
look upon the more stern and rugged aspects of nature.</i>
The dwellers in the former climate are ardent, vivacious,
and mercurial; the inhabitants of the latter are slow, deliberate,
persistent, and conservative. One nation will be
speculative, enamored of plausible hypotheses, and prone
to hasty and brilliant generalization; the other will be
practical, intolerant of hypotheses, and clamorous for facts
and logical inferences from facts. In the former climate
the fine arts will be enthusiastically cultivated, and elegance
and taste, and all that is graceful in sentiment and
action, will find a congenial home; in the latter, the exact
sciences and the useful arts will be cultivated with persistence
and zeal. Under the former conditions, a religion of
poetry, of sentiment, of artistic display and imposing ceremonial,
will sway the popular mind; under the latter, a
religion of personal duty and purity, of social righteousness,
of active beneficence, and of universal charity, will
command respect.</p>

<p>These principles constitute what may be designated the
<i>statics</i> of history&mdash;the more or less stable and permanent
<i>conditions</i> under which the living forces of humanity are
developed.</p>

<p>The <i>dynamics</i> of history are the fundamental powers
and rational ideas of human nature. There are certain
primary ideas of the reason which are revealed in the uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>versal
consciousness of our race under the conditions of
experience&mdash;the exterior conditions of physical nature and
sensational life. Such are the ideas of substance and
cause, of unity and infinity, which govern all the processes
of discursive thought, and lead us to the recognition of
the uncreated and unconditioned Being; such the ideas
of right, of duty, of accountability, and of retribution
which regulate all the conceptions we form of our relations
to other moral beings, and constitute <i>morality</i>; such
the ideas of order, proportion, and harmony which preside
in the realm of art, and constitute the beau-ideal of <i>æsthetics</i>;
such the ideas of God, the soul, and immortality
which rule in the domain of <i>religion</i>, and constitute man
a religious being. In addition to these, there are the powers
of observation, of abstraction, of generalization, of inference,
the capacity of symbolic conception and expression,
the faculty of creative imagination, the powers of
invention, of foresight, and of scientific prevision. These
are the living forces of humanity, fundamentally the same
under all circumstances, but modified in their intensity
and development by geographical, climatal, and scenic
conditions. The providential adjustment and harmonious
relation of the exterior conditions with the inherent powers
of humanity is the problem of history.</p>

<p>Before attempting to trace the hand of Divine providence
in the original location and subsequent migrations
of the historic races, let us briefly reproduce the sentences
which express the <i>conditions</i> most favorable to the development
and perfection of humanity. 1. While the tropical
climate of Southern Asia, of Africa, and of South
America is unfavorable to the highest intellectual and
moral development, the temperate climate of Western
Asia, of Europe, and of North America is peculiarly adapt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ed
to minister to the advancement and perfection of the
human race. 2. The massive, unbroken continents of the
South, shut in by immense oceans and impassable mountain
ranges, are the seats of immobility and the home of
despotic power; but the deeply indented and elaborately
articulated continents of the North, with their inland seas
and large navigable rivers, are the theatre of activity, of
progress, and of liberty. 3. The sunny skies and glowing
landscapes and inspiring scenery of the south of Europe
are most congenial to poetry and music, and painting and
sculpture, and all that is graceful in expression and action;
the deeper tone and sterner features of the northern portion
of Europe, "whose skies are sombre, and whose mountains
are rugged and gray," determine it to be the home
of practical industry and useful arts, of benevolent enterprises
and philanthropic deeds. Bearing in mind these
principles, we turn to history in the belief that we shall
find that Divine providence has at successive periods placed
the historic races in such geographical relations and amid
such physical conditions as have been most favorable to
their intellectual and moral development.</p>

<p>1. The first historic fact to which we would now direct
attention is <i>that the human race really commenced its history
in the midst of the continents of the Temperate Zone</i>.
Western Asia was unquestionably the cradle of the human
race, the grand centre whence the different families
or races commenced their migrations.</p>

<p>Whatever views may be entertained of the doctrine supposed
to be taught in Gen. i.-iv. that the whole human
race originally descended from a single pair, or whatever
method of interpretation in regard to that ancient document
may finally prevail&mdash;even should we adopt the theory
of Dr. McCausland<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> that the Biblical account is concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
only with the origin of a covenant and redemptive race
(the Adamite or Edenic race), which was to be the instructor
and benefactor of the pre-Adamite races&mdash;there can be
no question that the sacred historian traces the source of
the great historic nations to the family of Noah (Gen. ix.
19). Whatever difficulties there may be in determining
the site of Eden&mdash;and they are confessedly great, if not
insurmountable&mdash;there is no difficulty in locating the second
geographical centre from whence the great historic
races departed to overspread the earth. Ararat is, no
doubt, in its Biblical import, the Armenian highlands, the
lofty plateau which overlooks the plains of the Araxes on
the north and Mesopotamia on the south. This "Armenian
plateau stands equidistant from the Euxine and the
Caspian seas on the north, and between the Persian Gulf
and the Mediterranean Sea on the south. With the first
it is connected by the Acampsis, with the second by the
Araxes, with the third by the Tigris and the Euphrates,
the latter of which serves as an outlet toward the countries
on the Mediterranean coast. These seas were the
highways of primitive colonization, and the plains watered
by these rivers were the seats of the most powerful nations
of antiquity&mdash;the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the
Medes, and the Colchians. Viewed with reference to
the dispersion of the nations, Armenia is the true ὀμφαλος&mdash;the
middle part&mdash;of the earth; and it is a significant
fact that at the present day Ararat is the great
boundary-stone between the empires of Russia, Turkey,
and Persia."<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The Scripture account, which certainly authorizes us to
fix upon the highlands of Armenia as the new centre
whence the descendants of Noah went forth to people the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
earth, is confirmed by the most ancient traditions and the
most reliable historic records. Josephus tells us there was
in Armenia a city which was called Ἀποβατήριον&mdash;the
Place of Descent<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>&mdash;"for the ark being saved in that place,
its remains are shown by the inhabitants to this day."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
He further adds that "all the writers of the barbarian
histories make mention of the flood, and of this ark, among
whom is Berosus, the Chaldæan,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> who, when he goes on to
describe the circumstances of the flood, remarks, 'it is said
there is still some part of this ship in Armenia, at the
mountain of the Cordyæans;' Hieronymus, the Egyptian,
who wrote the Phoenician antiquities, and Manases, and indeed
a great many others, also make mention of the same.
Nay, Nicholas of Damascus, in his ninety-sixth book,
hath a particular relation about them, where he speaks
thus: 'There is a great mountain in Armenia, over Minyas,
called Baris, upon which, it is reported,... that one
who was carried in an ark came on shore upon the top
of it, and that the remains of the timber were a great
while preserved.'"<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>This concurrent testimony of sacred and profane history,
which designates Western Asia as the cradle of the
historic nations, has received additional confirmation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the researches of modern ethnologists and philologists. In
the tenth chapter of Genesis, the sacred historian sketches
the nations of the earth at his time of writing, indicates
their ethnic affinities, and marks to some extent their
geographical positions. The professor of ancient history
in the University of Oxford, George Rawlinson, remarks
that "the <i>Toldoth Beni Noah</i> (the Generations of
Noah) has excited the admiration of modern ethnologists,
who continually find in it the anticipations of their greatest
discoveries."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Sir Henry Rawlinson assures us that
"the Toldoth Beni Noah is undoubtedly the <i>most authentic</i>
record we possess of the affiliations of the human race
which sprang from the triple stock of the Noachidæ."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
The same distinguished Oriental scholar in an essay "On
the Ethnic Affinities of the Nations of Western Asia," fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>ther
remarks: "In Western Asia, the cradle of the human
race, the several ethnic branches of the human family were
more closely intermingled and more evenly balanced than
in any other portion of the ancient world. Semitic, Indo-European,
and Tâtar or Turanian races not only divided
among them this portion of the earth's surface, but lay interspersed
and confused upon it in a most remarkable entanglement.
It is symptomatic of this curious intermixture
that the Persian monarchs, when they wished to communicate
to their Asiatic subjects in such a way that it
should be generally intelligible, had to put it out not only
in three different languages, but in three languages belonging
to the <i>three principal divisions of human speech</i>.
Hence the trilingual inscriptions of Behistun, Persepolis,
etc., which consist of an Indo-European, a Tâtar, and a
Semitic column."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Thus do all the varied lines of evidence proceeding from
history, ethnology, and philology converge upon Western
Asia as the cradle of the human race&mdash;the centre from
which the families of mankind departed to people the
earth; and we are constrained to regard the early populations
of that region as furnishing the <i>typical</i> standard
or average sample of our species.</p>

<p>Proceeding from a purely zoological stand-point, we
should be led to an opposite conclusion. Looking to the
general phenomena of the geographical distribution of animals,
and the natural rather than the artificial conditions
of human existence, and arguing solely on naturalistic
grounds, we should be constrained to place the centre of
our race in the tropics; and of the intertropical regions
those which are the habitat of the anthropoid (or anthropomorphic)
ape, as Western Africa and the southern ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>tremity
of Asia. In the protoplasts of his species the mere
zoologist sees but so many naked bipeds, with the capabilities,
indeed, of working out for their future behoof the essentials
of clothing, the use of fire, and the like, but in the
first instance unfit for any climate except the mildest, and
incapable of sustenance on any soil except the most luxuriant.
He consequently fixes upon the tropics as the
cradle of our race; and those who assume the lineal descent
of the human species from the quadrumana fix upon
those intertropical points which are the habitats of the
anthropomorphic apes.</p>

<p>The law which governs the distribution and development
of vegetable and animal life would also lead us to fix upon
the tropical regions as the geographical centre of our race.
That law may be thus stated: <i>The degree of perfection of
the types of life, and the diversity and number of species,
are proportional to the intensity of heat.</i> In this progress,
as Humboldt has remarked, we find organic life and
vigor gradually augmenting with the increase of temperature.
And the number of species increases as we approach
the equator, and decreases as we retire from it.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>In the Frigid Zone life seems almost extinguished during
the greater part of the year by the rigors of an almost
perpetual winter. The vegetation of the polar regions
is stunted, dull, and monotonous in color, and inadequate
to sustain animal life. The plains are covered with
mosses and lichens, and here and there a few herbs and
shrubs (saxifrages, gentians, papaver, etc.), but no stately
forest trees. In short, the general characteristic of these
cold regions is the preponderance of cryptogamous plants.
In the Temperate Zone we have a marked superiority in
vegetable life. Here we have grassy pastures, cerealia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
and dicotyledonous trees&mdash;the oak, ash, beech, maple, chestnut,
walnut, the apple, pear, plum, etc. The number of
genera and species is greatly increased, and the superior
types acquire a fuller development. The preponderance
of phanerogamous plants, the richer coloring, and the appearance
of evergreen trees, are the signs of an immense
progress. But the soft tints, the medium forms, and the
wintry sleep extending through half the year, clearly indicate
that the perfection of physical nature is not attained.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
It is in the heat of the Torrid Zone where nature
puts forth all her energy, and displays her greatest resources.
"The cryptogamous plants attain, in arborescent
forms, the proportions of our forest trees. The grasses
which we know in our climates only under the humble
forms they put on in our fields, rise, in the elegant and
majestic bamboo, to the height of sixty or seventy feet.
A single tree is a garden, wherein a hundred different
plants intertwine their branches, and display their brilliant
flowers on a ground of verdure, where their varied hues
and forms of leaves are richly blended." And here the
perfection of vegetable life is attained in the graceful
palms which stand at the head and crown the vegetable
kingdom. This is the region of a perpetual summer, where
nature makes ample provision for the support of animal
life, and the date, the cocoa-nut, the banana, the plantain,
the sugar-cane, the pine-apple, supply all the wants of uncivilized
man.</p>

<p>The same gradation is marked in the animal kingdom.
The most characteristic feature of the arctic fauna is its
dull uniformity. The species are few in number, their
forms are regular, and their tints are dusky as the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>ern
heavens. The most conspicuous animals are the reindeer,
the white bear, and the various seals; but the most
important are the whales, which rank lowest of all the
mammals. The preponderance of marine animals clearly
indicates an inferior development. The faunas of the
temperate regions are much more varied than in the Arctic
Zone. Instead of consisting mainly of aquatic tribes,
we have a considerable number of terrestrial animals of
graceful form, animated appearance, and varied coloring,
though less brilliant than those found in tropical regions.
It is in the tropics that animal life attains its highest
development. The boundless variety of species, the richness
of the colors, the diversity of forms, the size and
strength of the great pachyderms that people the forests
and rivers, the fleetness and vigor of the ferocious denizens
of the jungle and the plain, all attest that this is the
privileged zone. And here only are found the quadrumanæ,
which stand at the head of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Such, then, is clearly the law of the physical world.
"Nature goes on adding perfection to perfection from the
polar regions to the Temperate Zone, and from the Temperate
Zone to the region of the greatest heat." Animal life
increases in strength and development; the types are improved;
intelligence enlarges; the form approaches nearer
the human figure; the ourang-outang occasionally stands
erect; and the presence of the mastoid and styloid processes,
the development of the heel-bone, and the form of
the pelvis, together with the shape of the ears and a higher
frontal development, give the gorilla a startling resemblance
to man. Following, then, the ascending series (especially
if man be regarded as the lineal descendant of
the anthropomorphic apes), we might reasonably suppose
that here would be found the proper home and habitat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
man, and that the tropical man would be the highest type
of humanity, and, physically speaking, the most beautiful
of the species.</p>

<p>But this, as every one knows, is not the case. While
all the types of plants and of animals go on increasing in
perfection from the polar to the equatorial regions in proportion
to the increase of temperature, "man presents to
our view his purest, his most perfect type at the very centre
of the temperate continents, at the centre of Asia-Europe,
in the region of Iran, of Armenia, and of the Caucasus;,
and, departing from this geographical centre in the
three grand directions of the lands, the types gradually
lose the beauty of their forms in proportion to their distance,
even to the extreme points of the southern continents,
where we find the most deformed and [physically]
degenerated races, and the lowest in the scale of humanity."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>The distribution of the human race over the face of the
earth has thus been governed by a different law from that
which has governed the distribution of plants and animals.</p>

<p>In the latter case, the degree of perfection of the types
is exactly proportional to the intensity of heat and other
material conditions favorable to the development of physical
life. <i>This is the law of a physical order.</i></p>

<p>In the former case, in man, the degree of perfection of
the types is in proportion to the degree of intellectual and
moral improvement, and to the physical conditions favorable
to intellectual and moral development. <i>This is the
law of a moral order.</i></p>

<p>This difference between the two laws has its ground and
reason in the essential difference between the nature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
destination of these different orders of being. The plant
and the animal are not destined to become a different
thing from what they already are. The end of their existence
is already attained. The development of each individual
is bound to an immutable necessity of nature.
Therefore vegetable life and organization are ceaselessly
uniform; there are always the same cellular structures and
the same morphological forms. Unreasoning and instinctive
life never leaves its sphere. The beaver builds its
dam, lives, and dies, just as it did six thousand years ago.
The bee builds the same hexagonal cell she built before
the flood. There is an all-pervading order in the physical
world, But with man it is quite otherwise. Man, created
in the image of God, is a free moral being. He is
not solely under the dominion of mere nature-conditions,
and he is therefore a progressive being. The physical
man is not the true man; the body is not an end, but a
means. There is another man&mdash;the intellectual, the moral,
the spiritual man&mdash;which grows up with the body, and
to which the physical man is a servant and minister. The
unfolding, the development, the perfection of this spiritual
nature is the grand end of man. This development
can only take place under freedom; this nature be unfolded
only by education; the maturity and the perfection of
man secured only by the exercise and discipline of his
spiritual powers.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Who does not see a plan, a purpose, a Providence in
this fact that the cradle of the human race was placed in
the midst of the continents of the north and not at the
centre of the tropical regions? The balmy but enervating
atmosphere of the equatorial regions would have lulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
man to sleep, and he would have made no progress. With
an abundant supply for his natural wants, there would have
been no motive to industry, to enterprise, and to the development
of his intellectual powers. Unable to endure
the rigors of a colder climate, and to live on a less luxuriant
soil, he could not have been induced to migrate to
less favorable regions, and, crowded on a narrow area, the
race must have been finally exterminated. But planted in
the Temperate Zone, in the midst of the continents of the
North, so well adapted by their forms, their highly articulated
peninsulas, and their climate to stimulate the active
powers of man, to promote enterprise, to favor commerce,
and hasten individual development and social organization,
he was surrounded by conditions most favorable to the fulfillment
of his destiny.</p>


<p>It is also worthy of being noted that Western Asia was
not only the geographical centre of the human race, but
also the grand centre of religious light&mdash;the cradle of
man's spiritual nature. It was here in the midst of the
six great nations of antiquity&mdash;the Babylonians, the Assyrians,
Medes, Persians, Phoenicians, and Egyptians&mdash;that
for ages "the living oracles" proclaimed the "Truth of
God," and patriarchs and prophets and seers were received
into intercourse with the higher world. And it
was in Palestine, the centre of the three continents of the
Old World, and near five great seas&mdash;the highways of the
world's travel and commerce&mdash;that Jesus of Nazareth taught
"the glad tidings of great joy" for the nations, and sent
forth his apostles "into all the world to preach that Gospel
to every creature."</p>


<p>2. Another important fact which history enables us very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
distinctly to recognize is <i>that those epochs of civilization
which represent the highest degree of culture attained by
man at different periods in his history have not succeeded
one another in the same place, but have passed from one
country to another</i>.</p>

<p>It is an undoubted historic fact, as we have already seen,
that Asia was the cradle of the human race. Western
Asia is the theatre of the earliest civilization of which we
have any historic records. Then a newer and higher
form appears on the peninsula of Greece. The centre
of civilization again changes place, and Rome embraces
and improves upon that of the ancient world. Then
passing the Alps, still further to the west, it spreads over
France and Germany and the British Isles, and assumes
a nobler form; and finally it crosses the Atlantic Ocean,
and develops its highest type in the New World. This
order may be called the geographical march of civilization.</p>

<p>In the principle we enounced at the opening of this
chapter, that the earth is the school-house of man&mdash;its
highest function being to aid in his intellectual and moral
training, and furnish the conditions in which he may fulfill
his noble destiny&mdash;we can recognize at once the reason
and the law of this remarkable progression. And as no
single continent furnishes all the conditions necessary to
the complete development of man, and each of the three
northern continents, by virtue of its structure and climate
and physical conditions, has a special function to fulfill
in the education of mankind, so God, in his providence,
has led the human family from east to west, over the continents
of the Temperate Zone, in order to secure the education,
the moral advancement, and the final perfection of
our race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>The education of the race has, no doubt, proceeded
very much in the same manner as the education of the individual.
The general law observable in the development
of one human mind may be traced in the development of
humanity as a whole. That which takes place on the limited
field of individual consciousness may also be found
upon the larger field of universal consciousness, which is
the theatre of history; and as one epoch succeeds another
in the progress of the individual, so must it be in the progress
of nations. What, then, are the clear and obvious
stages in the development of the human mind? Do we
not clearly recognize the following order?</p>

<p>1. <i>The period of submission to absolute authority.</i> This
is the first condition of infancy. The child is controlled
absolutely by the will of the parent. It is almost passive
amid surrounding conditions, and parental authority is its
only law of movement and action.</p>

<p>2. <i>The discipline of the conscience.</i> This is the era of
childhood. The ideas of the right and the good are developed
in the mind. An internal law of duty begins to
reveal itself. The child begins to discriminate between
what he ought and ought not to do. And in the education
of the child the object of a wise and virtuous parent
is to strengthen this tendency by urging him to act upon
these ideas.</p>

<p>3. <i>The development of personal liberty</i>&mdash;that is, of independent
thought and self-originated action. This is the
period of youth. The youth passes from the control of
his parents and teachers, and begins to think and act for
himself.</p>

<p>4. <i>The training and discipline of the will under social
law</i>&mdash;that is, the voluntary obedience to laws imposed by
society, submission to regulations imposed for the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
good. This is the period of manhood. The young man
passes into society, he becomes a member of the body politic,
and freely acts, not simply as an individual, but as a
member of a corporation and of a state.</p>

<p>5. <i>The development of active philanthropy.</i> The man
advances beyond the claims of social law, and acts from
the promptings of love and good-will toward all men.
Passing through all the varied stages in the progressive
development of human character, and retaining the results
of each, he becomes the perfect man.</p>

<p>And now it will be promptly recognized that this has
been the order of progress in humanity as a whole&mdash;that
is, the progress of history and of civilization. The first
corresponds with <i>Oriental</i>, the second with <i>Hebrew</i>, the
third with <i>Greek</i>, the fourth with <i>Roman</i>, and the last
with <i>Christian</i> civilization.</p>

<p>It will also be observed that each epoch in the development
of the individual has demanded new conditions, and
has taken place in a new sphere. The first stage in the
development of individual character is infoldment in the
arms of the parent. He is still held, as it were, within the
circle of maternal life. He is bewildered by the vastness
and variety of external nature, and he sinks back into his
mother's arms. The second sphere is in the bosom of the
family and amid the scenes of domestic life, where he recognizes
relations and becomes conscious of duties. The
third is in the school and the outer world, where thought
awakens, and, enjoying more freedom of movement, he becomes
more conscious of his personal liberty. The fourth
is in society, the state, the arena of political life, where his
movements must be regulated by law; and the pursuit of
his own pleasure or aggrandizement must not interfere
with the rights of his fellow-man. The fifth and last is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
in the church, the home of religious life, where he is called
to ascend from the region of mere law to that of holy
love. So also each epoch in the development of humanity
has had its separate sphere and its new conditions, first
in Asia proper, next in Palestine, on the borders of the
Mediterranean Sea, then on the peninsula of Greece, then
in Italy, and lastly in Continental Europe, England, and
America.</p>

<p>1. Asia, as we have seen, was the cradle of the race.
Here, in the infancy of humanity, Oriental Civilization
dawns. Amid the extended plains and lofty mountains
of Asia, those stupendous and massive forms of Oriental
nature, man felt himself absolutely dependent. To the
river he looked as the fertilizer of the soil; to the animal
which roamed in the desert, and the almost spontaneous
vegetation of the earth, for his food; to the sun, as the
fountain of light and heat, the giver of life and death.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
He was environed and overpowered by nature. Almost
unconscious of his own freedom, he lay in her bosom, as
the child reposes in the arms of its mother. Underlying
all the massive forms of Oriental nature he recognized an
invisible Power and Presence, and he worshiped nature
as an impersonation of God. Every thing inspired him
with the sense of the Infinite, the consciousness of dependence
on an absolute Will. The patriarchal government,
imposed by nature, restrained his personal liberty.
His property and life were at the disposal of his chief&mdash;an
absolute autocrat, who exercised over him an unlimited
power. Oriental civilization unquestionably represents
the <i>infancy</i> of man.</p>

<p>2. In Hebrew civilization we have, as an especial feature,
the discipline of the conscience. The child-man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
comes more directly under the power of moral culture.
The government and discipline to which he is now subjected
aim to develop in his mind the idea of the just, the
right, the pure. He is receiving instruction in what he
ought and ought not to do. His conceptions of the moral
character of God are to be enlarged, the idea especially of
the holiness of God is to be developed in his mind through
the medium of material symbols and religious rites. The
call of Abraham sets forth at once the central lesson of
faith in an unseen personal God. The history of the patriarchs
brings into clearer light the sovereignty of God
as opposed to the mere dominion of nature and fate. A
nation grows up in presence of Egyptian culture, and after
the purpose of God in the discipline of Egypt is accomplished,
they are led into the wilderness, and God now reveals
Himself as a Lawgiver and Judge, and a ritual is
given which teaches at once the holiness of God and the
exceeding sinfulness of sin.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>For the achievement of this object a new sphere is demanded&mdash;the
seclusion and isolation of family life. Accordingly
Abraham was called to leave Chaldæa, the scene
of Oriental civilization, and led into Canaan, that he might
become the father of a great nation, and the source of a
new and better civilization. The mountainous region of
Palestine was admirably fitted to be the theatre of this
new civilization. No other land on the globe was so peculiarly
fitted to fulfill this office. The northern half of
Syria was not so favorable a locality; for traversed as it
was by the great highway from Asia Minor to Assyria, it
was subject to the influence of foreign travel from the
earliest times. But Palestine lay surrounded by populous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
countries, and yet isolated from them. In the midst of the
six great nations of antiquity&mdash;the Babylonians, the Assyrians,
the Medes, Persians, Phoenicians, and Egyptians&mdash;it was
separated from them all.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Thus secluded and isolated from
the rest of mankind, the Hebrews dwelt alone as one great
<i>family</i>. The first form of government was a patriarchy&mdash;the
father of the family and of the tribe being the ruler.
The second was a theocracy, in which God, the Father of
the families of all the earth, becomes the immediate ruler.
The third was a monarchy&mdash;the government of a man appointed
and sustained in his authority by God. And the
history of this nation is little else than one of instruction,
discipline, and chastisement&mdash;a tutelage in which the people
were under law and not under grace. The Hebrew
civilization represents the <i>childhood</i> of humanity.</p>

<p>And the lessons here taught were not lost to the race.
They were carried to Assyria and Babylonia during the
period of the two captivities; and in the colonies which
were founded in Asia Minor, Rome, and Alexandria the
influence exerted by Judaism was considerably greater
than that which was exerted upon it. The union of Judaism
and Platonism is fully represented in Philo the Alexandrian
Jew.</p>

<p>3. In Grecian civilization we have the development of
personal freedom of thought and action. The Divine
discipline of the Jews, as we have seen, was essentially a
moral discipline&mdash;a discipline of the conscience. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
however, was not a complete discipline of our whole
nature. The reason demands culture as well as the conscience.
The process and the issue in the two cases were
widely different, but they were in some sense complementary;
and the one succeeds the other in the order of time.
The Divine kingdom of the Jews was just overthrown
when free speculation arose in the Ionian colonies of Asia;
and the teaching of the last prophet nearly synchronizes
with the death of Socrates.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>This new civilization could not be achieved on the continent
of Asia, and therefore a new theatre is prepared.
"Europe may be called a continuation of Central Asia.
It surpasses its Oriental neighbor in the advantage of having
no internal mountain barrier to divide its north and
south. Thus Europe has been able to develop itself more
independently and freely in consequence of the number of
its peninsular forms.... The three characteristic features
in the formation of Europe that are the physical grounds
of the development of its nations are its large extent of
seaboard, its peninsular forms, and the number of its islands."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
On the peninsula of Greece, on the shores of the
Ægean and Ionian seas, there was freedom of movement,
facility of intercourse with the surrounding nations, and
inducements to maritime enterprise. These conditions
were undoubtedly favorable to a higher development.
"The inland sea, the magnificent river," says Cousin, "is
the natural symbol of <i>movement</i>." These represent the
activity of nature, and they become natural centres of
progress. The sea is the highway of commerce, and
commerce is the grand channel of ideas, the medium
through which the knowledge acquired by one people can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
flow readily into other lands. Amid such conditions the
mind awakes to activity, and the <i>period of youth</i> commences.
Awakening thought is first directed to the outer
world, and attempts an explanation of its phenomena.
Greek philosophy thus becomes, at its first appearance, a
philosophy of nature, and the Ionian school was a school
of physicists. Here the great names which appear at
the dawn of mental activity are Thales, Anaximander,
Anaximenes, Heraclites, and Diogenes. From the study
of nature the human race advances to the study of man.
The new school is a school of moral and mental philosophy,
or, more correctly, of psychology and ethics, adorned
by such immortal names as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
In Greece, philosophy, poetry, eloquence, the fine arts, were
extensively cultivated. As this was an age of great activity
of thought, so it was also an age of great political freedom.
The government was in many respects a government
of the people, a democracy. "Every thing, in fact,
in Greece bears evidence of the preponderance of human
personality, and the energy of individual character."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
Grecian civilization represents the <i>youth</i> of humanity.</p>

<p>The results of this culture were carried to other lands
by the conquests of Alexander, and subsequently by the
conquering Romans. The poets, the architects, the sculptors,
the historians, the philosophers of Greece, are still the
guides and models of the men of thought and taste in all
cultivated nations. The Greek is still, in a peculiar sense,
the teacher of the world.</p>

<p>4. In Roman civilization we have the discipline of the
will under social and civil law, the more perfect organization
of society and of government, the development of the
science of jurisprudence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>
<p>This social and political organization was a new work, a
higher civilization, and it demanded a new and, in fact, a
larger sphere. The centre of the civilized world now
changes place, and, moving westward, establishes itself
in the peninsula of Italy. By successive conquests its
circumference enlarges, and finally it embraces at once
the South and the East and the West. The place which
Rome occupied, in the very middle of the basin of the
Mediterranean Sea, seemed to foreshadow that she was
destined to become the metropolis of all the civilized nations
who dwelt upon its shores. Rome extended its conquests
to Spain, Gaul, Britain, Illyria, Greece, Asia Minor,
Egypt, Africa, and the islands of the Mediterranean&mdash;over,
in fact, six hundred thousand square leagues of the most
fertile country; and all but realized the dream of the
world's great conquerors&mdash;a universal empire. It was defended
by a regular army of five hundred thousand men,
ranged in the order of the famous legions, which constituted
the most effective military organization known.
The government of an empire of such vast proportions
and diversity of populations demanded the greatest political
skill. To establish durable ties between these diverse
peoples, and to combine in the same social network all
the civilized nations of the world, demanded the highest
legislative talent, and gave birth to the science of jurisprudence,
which, next to that of theology, is the most important
and useful to man. The inability of the Greek to
achieve this great work is clearly evinced by the terrible
Peloponnesian War and the lamentable history of the empire
of Alexander and his successors. Greece represents
individuality; Rome, association, unity, and, in some degree,
the equality of all races of men.</p>

<p>This was unquestionably a marvelous development: "In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
public law, the extension, step by step, through many a
civil commotion, of the full rights of citizenship from the
narrow circle of a few score of favored families to the entire
sphere of the free subjects of the empire; in private
law, the equal communication among various classes of the
rights of property and dominion over the national soil;
the abolition of territorial privileges; the readjustment, by
gradual and peaceful manipulation, of the cadastral map
of the empire; the relaxation, by slow and experimental
process, of the patriarchal authority of the head of the
family; of the father over the son, whom at first he might
punish, sell, or slay; of the husband over the wife, whom
at first he received from her parents as the spoil of his own
spear, and ruled as the chattel he had plundered;<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> of the
master over the slave, absolute at first, final and irresponsible
to law, custom, or conscience; the gradual replacement
of the strictly national and tribal ideas on these subjects
by views of right, justice, and virtue to mankind in
general; the slow but constant growth of principles of
natural and universal law, and their application, searchingly
and thoroughly, to every subject of jurisprudence,
and to all the dealings of man with man."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>This vast Roman Empire combined all the elements of
civilization characteristic of former periods. The philosopher,
the lawyer, and the statesman were united in the person
of her great men, as Cicero and Cato, and sometimes
also the warrior, as in the case of the first of the Cæsars. The
days of the Roman Republic present the most brilliant social
and political epoch in the history of the ancient world.
The life of a Roman citizen was emphatically a public life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
The love of country was carried to the highest pitch, and
was paramount to every other consideration. The laws
and jurisprudence of Ancient Rome have furnished models
for the whole civilized world. "The world-wide elastic
system of jurisprudence by which the great Roman
Empire, with all its boundless variety of races, creeds, and
manners, was for ages harmoniously and equitably governed;
which was accepted and ratified as an eternal possession
by the same empire when it became Christian; and has
been proved to satisfy the principles of law and justice
announced by a religion which alone proclaimed the unity
and equality of man;... finally, a jurisprudence which
has been incorporated into the particular legal systems of,
I suppose, every modern nation in Christendom," marks a
high degree of civilization, and justifies us in regarding Roman
civilization as representing the <i>manhood</i> of our race.</p>

<p>5. And now comes, last of all, the Christian civilization,
or the age of philanthropy. When the Roman Empire
had attained its zenith, and all civilized nations were
brought under one government; and the world was at
peace; and the philosophy of Greece and the jurisprudence
of Rome had prepared the way for a higher and
a nobler civilization, then, "in the fullness of time"&mdash;the
ripeness and maturity of the ages or dispensations&mdash;"God
sent his Son, made under the law, to redeem them that
are under the law, that we might receive the <i>adoption of
sons</i>." He came to exhibit completely the truth which
had been partially revealed to Plato, that "<i>God is Love</i>"&mdash;that
"Love is creation's final law"&mdash;and that the completeness
and perfection of humanity is "<i>resemblance to
God</i>."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> He came to announce and enforce the brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>hood
of mankind, and the equality of all classes and races
in the sight of God. He proclaimed the equal worth of
all human souls in the estimation of the heavenly Father;
and to prove that all men are alike the objects of Divine care
and solicitude, He laid down his life as "a propitiation for
the sins of the whole world." For the reception of this gospel
of universal brotherhood and equal rights the Grecian
and Roman civilizations had prepared the way. And now
He gives to the race the "new commandment," which is the
fundamental law of the Kingdom of God, and is finally to
become the universal law for all nations, that "<i>Men should
love one another, as He loved all men, and laid down his
life for them.</i>" The whole spirit and tendency of this
crowning form of civilization can not be misapprehended.
Its sympathies are all with the poor, the suffering, and the
oppressed; it can not fail to overthrow castes and aristocracies,
to destroy tyranny, oppression, and slavery, and at last
to unite all men in bonds of love to each other and to God.</p>

<p>And now to what people shall be committed the office
of diffusing and perpetuating this noblest and highest civilization?
Not to the Jewish nation, for it was exclusive and
selfish; not to the Greek, for it had become effete; not to
the Roman, for it had become corrupt. Christianity, it is
true, was born on Jewish soil, but it was soon transferred to
a more favorable clime. The Church was early planted in
Rome, but achieved its grandest conquests among another
people. The fierce Germanic tribes of the North conquer
the Roman Empire, and are conquered by its Christianity.
Already the Germans had the conception of an illimitable
Deity, toward whom they looked with solemn and reverential
awe.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Having penetrated into the midst of the Roman
Empire, they came fully into the presence and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the influence of Christianity. Their conversion was speedy
and comparatively complete. The constant intercourse now
maintained between Rome and Central and Northern Europe
in a short time carried this new civilization across the
Alps; the circle rapidly widens, and embraces all Europe
in a common faith.</p>

<p>All the rich treasures of the past are appropriated by
Christianity&mdash;the moral culture of the Hebrew, the poetry
and philosophy of Greece, the jurisprudence of Ancient
Rome. All these&mdash;in so far as they are pure and good&mdash;are
absorbed by Christianity, and ennobled and baptized
by the Christian spirit. In Christian Europe poetry, philosophy,
science flourished as they had never flourished in
any preceding age, and they lay their richest tribute at the
feet of Christ, the Divine King of the world. Nature,
also, herself becomes more and more subject to man, and
to the religion of the God-man. Science multiplies the
means of diffusing knowledge and the facilities of intercourse
among the nations of the earth. The discovery of
the art of printing opens the Book of Life to the millions
of our race. Space has been annihilated by railroads; by
the help of steam continents are united; the electric telegraph
is binding the nations in one. And now the genius
of Christianity begins more signally to reveal itself as a
power acting on the social life of man. The forms and
conditions of his earthly lot are being wonderfully transformed
and improved. Science is emancipating labor,
and constantly overcoming the sources of human suffering.
Hygienic science is preserving life and extending
the term of human existence. Mankind is rising above
the sphere of mere law, into the sphere of noble love.
Philanthropic institutions are being daily multiplied, humanitarian
and Christian enterprises most vigorously pros<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>ecuted,
and a noble benevolence is rapidly supplanting the
ignoble selfishness of former ages. Chalmers, Howard,
Wilberforce, Hitchcock, Amos Lawrence, Elizabeth Fry,
Florence Nightingale, Mrs. Gladstone, are representative
men and women of the new age.</p>

<p>Christian civilization is no longer the property of any
one nation alone. Now it embraces in its purposes and
plans the evangelization of all the nations of the earth. The
world is now its field. The accumulated waves of light
and power from Hebrew and Grecian and Roman civilizations,
to which Christianity has added a new life and
force, are destined to roll back a tide of blessing upon the
remnants of those ancient nations, and sweep northward
and southward&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Till like a sea of glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It spreads from pole to pole."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The crowning achievement of a Christian civilization
will be the political regeneration of the nations&mdash;the establishment
of all human governments on the principles
of human equality, natural rights, and the brotherhood of
man. The glory of this achievement, in all its fullness, is
not, however, the work of Europe. She inherits too positively
the martial spirit of Ancient Rome. Ancient customs
and prescriptions, hereditary castes, aristocracies, and
kings, and an ecclesiastical polity moulded by these, stand
in the way of a Christianity of equality, of freedom, and
of universal brotherhood. Europe has her roots too deeply
infixed in the past to adapt herself, fully and readily, to
the enlarged principles of a thoroughly Christian civilization.
A new country is therefore needed, a <i>New World</i>,
where Christianity can remodel human society, and reconstruct
human governments upon her own principles, and
the human race can enter upon the last stage in its prog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>ress
toward the now visible portals of its final goal. "The
East," says Ritter, "represents <i>hope</i>, the West, <i>fulfillment</i>."
That new continent was discovered just at the proper hour.
Had North America been discovered earlier, it would have
been peopled by Catholic nations, and the noble civilization
which Christianity was designed to achieve would
have been cramped and fettered by the hand of an ecclesiastical
hierarchy. The New World reposed quietly in
the bosom of a yet untraversed ocean awaiting the advent
of the Protestant Reformation. Luther drew the Bible
from its concealment in the library of the University of
Erfurt at the same time (1502) that Columbus discovered
the American continent.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The first settlers in New England were eminently Protestant.
They were men who loved the Word of God, and
they sought to organize society in this new country upon
its holy principles. This new colonization had its birth
amid the agonizing throes of martyrdom. The "Pilgrim
Fathers" had been persecuted and driven from home for
Christ's sake. They sought the desert that they might
have freedom to worship God according to the dictates of
their own consciences; and they braved the dangers of
the almost untraveled deep, and the perils of an inhospitable
shore in mid-winter, to lay the foundations of a new
empire which should be the home of liberty, and the sanctuary
of piety for themselves and their children. The Puritan
love of freedom and reverence for religion has left
its impress on the mind and character of the American
people, upon their modes of thought, and upon the institutions
of their country. The ideas of universal liberty
and equal justice are interwoven in her Constitution, and,
in general, the spirit of her legislation has been in accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>ance
therewith. A relic of barbarism landed at Jamestown,
in Virginia, which after a fierce struggle of years
was finally conquered, and the rank offense was expiated
by tears and blood. God has destroyed slavery
in America by "the breath of his mouth," and its death-knell
has sounded all over the globe. The cause of freedom
is stronger in Europe as the reflex of her triumphs here.</p>

<p>Finally, a remarkable characteristic of the civilization
of the New World is the emancipation of man from the
dominion of nature. By an amazing fertility of mechanical
contrivance man is here rapidly "subduing the earth."
Released from merely local and hereditary ties, he spreads
freely over the vast territory, and rapidly multiplies the
means of easy locomotion. The soil is being extensively
cultivated; the climate, even, modified; the physiognomy
of nature changed by the intelligence of man; and a regenerated
earth is to be, at last, the consequence of a regenerated
race. Physical nature sympathizes with the intellectual
and moral condition of man. Science is anticipating
the time "when the earth will only produce cultivated
plants and domestic animals; when man's selection
shall have supplanted 'natural selection;' and
when the ocean alone will be the only domain in which
that power can be exerted which for countless cycles of
ages ruled supreme over the earth."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> "The whole creation
has groaned and travailed together in pain until now,... waiting
for the manifestation of the sons of God."</p>

<p>"Verily there is a God" that not only judges in the
earth, but guides and instructs the nations, and who in the
development of the earth and of history "worketh all
things according to his eternal counsel and purpose," that
for the rational creation "God may be all in all."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br/>
SPECIAL PROVIDENCE AND PRAYER.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"England's thinkers are again beginning to see, what they had only temporarily
forgotten, that the difficulties of metaphysics lie at the root of all
science."&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. S. Mill.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>The most sharply defined issue between Science and
Religion&mdash;in fact, the only real issue at the present time&mdash;is
in regard to the doctrine of Special Providence and the
efficacy of Prayer.</p>

<p>These are not in reality two distinct questions: they are
but opposite phases of one and the same question. The
doctrine of special providence is the <i>theoretic</i> aspect, and
the doctrine of the efficacy of prayer is the <i>practical</i> aspect
of the Christian doctrine of the relation of God to
nature and man. We can not, therefore, discuss the practical
question apart from the theoretic; neither can we
reach any decisive conclusions in regard to either unless
we start with clear and well-defined conceptions of the
fundamental relations between God and nature, and between
God and man.</p>

<p>We shall assume the existence of God as the common
postulate of all religion and of all philosophy. If
this be denied, then all discussion of the present question
is useless, because we have no common starting-point.
But it will not be denied, we think, that the vast
majority of scientific men are agreed that the idea of
God is the necessary presupposition of all those branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of science which concern themselves with "genetic problems"&mdash;that
is, with problems of origin; and which, strictly
speaking, are not problems of science, but of philosophy.
These scientists may not all choose to employ
the term "God," but they will all recognize, with Mr.
Spencer, the existence of "an unconditioned Cause" as
"the ultimate of all ultimates," and they will admit with
him that the First Cause must be infinite, absolute, and
perfect, "including within itself all power and transcending
all law."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Mr. Spencer calls this idea of a First
Cause "a datum of consciousness;" and he asserts that this
"inexpugnable consciousness, in which religion and philosophy
are at one with common-sense, is likewise that
on which all exact science is founded."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Taking this fundamental presupposition as generally
conceded&mdash;namely, the existence of a Power which is unoriginated
and independent; a Power which is conscious
of itself and determines itself; a Power which transcends
all law and is the source of all law&mdash;the question at issue
may be thus stated&mdash;<i>Have our prayers any influence with
this Power?</i> Can they in any way affect the Divine feeling
and action toward us? Do they have any indirect
influence upon that succession of events in nature and history
which is effectuated and determined by that Supreme
Power? This is the real question at issue between science
and religion.</p>

<p>Nothing need be said to deepen our sense of the importance
of this issue. We all regard it as one of the
vital questions of the hour, the most vital question for religious
men, yea, the most vital question for scientific men,
inasmuch as there are moments of sadness and sorrow, of
doubt and mystery, when man feels that his only refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
is in prayer, and, science or no science, he must pray. But
if there is no living God to sympathize with us in our sorrow
and help us in our deepest need, or, which amounts to
the same thing, if God is so completely environed by laws
which He has Himself enacted, and so imprisoned in his
own works that He can do nothing to aid us, then prayer
is an illusion, and instead of being in any way beneficial
to us, it inflicts a deep and irreparable injury upon our intellectual
and moral life. If there is nothing in the universe
but mechanical force and necessary law; if there
is no freedom and no moral purpose, then prayer for help
and succor and guidance is a conscious or unconscious deception
practiced by the soul upon itself, and the sooner
we are undeceived the better; for of all deception the
most pernicious and depraving is that which a man practices
upon himself. We could not even accept the cold
apology for prayer which was made by David Hume, that
it may have a wholesome reflex influence upon the mind
of the worshiper, and be a good way of preaching to ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
There can be nothing useful or helpful in the
belief and practice of a lie. No accession of moral force
or moral purity can come from doing any thing in which
we do not believe. If there is any moral value and any
real helpfulness in prayer, it must be based upon a <i>rational</i>
belief that the Divine mind is accessible to the supplication
of his creature, and that the Divine will is moved
thereby. "He that cometh to God must believe that He
is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek
Him."</p>

<p>Humbly professing this belief without any reservation,
and regarding it as a perfectly rational belief, we proceed
to defend it against certain so-called scientific objections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
and to consider certain difficulties which present themselves
to the minds of scientific men.</p>

<p>We have said that there is a <i>real</i> issue between science
and religion as to the efficacy of prayer. The statement
is not strictly correct, and we amend it by saying that the
issue is not between science and religion, but between
certain men who study and teach science and certain
men who study and teach religion. For, as Mr. Murphy
observes, "The antagonism between science and religion
themselves is purely imaginary. The antagonism between
the men who study and teach science and the men who
study and teach religion is unfortunately sometimes real,
though it is the fashion [just now] to exaggerate it; but so
far as it is real it is an accident of the present time, which
will disappear, and indeed is already visibly disappearing."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>No man is in a position to affirm that there is an antagonism
between science and religion until he has first
clearly determined the sphere and function of each, and
can say distinctly <i>what science is and what religion is</i>.
He may have utterly misconceived the nature of religion,
or he may have misapprehended the function of science,
and therefore the supposed antagonism may be purely
imaginary. For example, Herbert Spencer says, "Every
religion may be defined as an <i>à priori</i> theory of the universe."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
If this definition were correct, we could easily
conceive how religion and modern science might come
into collision, because the tendency of science at the present
time is to occupy itself with "questions of origin"&mdash;that
is, with "theories of the origin of things," instead of
being, as Spencer defines it, "a systematic collection of
facts, ascertained with precision, and so classified and gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>eralized
as to reveal the uniform relations of co-existence
and succession among phenomena, and thus give <i>prevision</i>."
This is the legitimate sphere of all that science
which can lay any claim to be regarded as "exact science."
When it transcends this limit it ceases to be science and
becomes philosophy&mdash;a philosophy which will be more or
less valid and legitimate as it recognizes the authority and
submits to the guidance of <i>à priori</i> ideas of the reason.</p>

<p>But is Mr. Spencer's definition of religion correct?
We think not. Indeed, it would be difficult to give a definition
of religion wider from the mark. He might with
just as much propriety have said that religion is an <i>à priori</i>
theory of the origin of language, of government, of
trade, or of music. Either Mr. Spencer must have made
this definition for an unworthy purpose, or he must be in
utter darkness as to the nature of religion. One needs
only to cast a hasty glance over the history of ancient religions,
or to consider with an unprejudiced mind any of
the contemporaneous forms of religion, to be convinced
that religion is, and always has been, a mode of life determined
by the sense of dependence upon a Supreme
Power.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Religion has always been a matter of practical
interest and personal concernment, and has no more to do
with "theories of the universe" than with theories of light,
or theories of electricity, or theories of political economy.</p>

<p>The separate spheres of religion and science have been
admirably defined by James Martineau in a few words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>&mdash;"Science
discloses the <i>Method</i> of the world but not its
cause; religion [or theology] discloses the <i>Cause</i> of the
world but not its method. There is no conflict between
them except when either forgets its ignorance of what
the other alone can know."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> This is well said, and
directly to the point. Religion, or more properly theology
(for theology is the objective correlate and piety
the subjective correlate of religion), teaches <i>what God
is</i>, what are his attributes, what are the moral and spiritual
relations which subsist between God and man, and
what are the duties which arise out of these relations.
Science teaches <i>what nature is</i>, and what are the relations
and laws of natural phenomena. Science is the co-ordination
of phenomena. Here no conflict can arise. The
truths which are taught by each rest on their own appropriate
evidence, and they are capable of verification by direct
or indirect reduction to experience&mdash;the facts of science
to external experience, and the facts of religion to internal
experience. These experiences can not, in the nature
of the case, be contradictory, because religion deals
with one class of facts and science with another. Such
being the case, the scientist may be as certain of the reality
of religion as of the reality of science&mdash;that is, he may
be directly and immediately conscious of the same feeling
of reverence, the same sense of dependence, the same feeling
of obligation, and the same loyalty of soul toward the
unseen "Power which makes for righteousness,"<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> which
is experienced by the unscientific believer. This is frankly
avowed by Dr. Tyndall. He says, "The facts of religious
feeling are to me as certain as the facts of phys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>ics;"
and he refers with evident emotion to a period in
his earlier years when he "prized the conscious strength
and pleasure derived from moral and religious feeling."
"Give me," he says, "their health, and there is no spiritual
experience of those earlier years, no resolve of duty
or work of mercy, no act of self-denial, no solemnity of
thought, no joy in the life and aspect of nature which
would not still be mine."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> We doubt not that there are
thousands of scientific men who to-day might bear the
same testimony.</p>

<p>Here the question will suggest itself, How, then, comes
it to pass that there exists any antagonism between the
teachers of science and the teachers of religion? We
answer, the antagonism has arisen on that debatable ground
which lies between the two, where speculative thought,
whether from the stand-point of religion or the stand-point
of science, seeks to form definite conceptions of the relation
between God and nature, to bring our outer and
inner experiences into a higher unity of reason, and to
construct "<i>à priori</i> theories of the origin of things."</p>

<p>We do not presume to say that these metaphysical speculations
are either futile or improper. But what we do
insist upon, and beg the reader distinctly to note, is that
these speculations are neither <i>scientific</i> nor <i>religious</i>, and
that neither true science nor true religion is responsible
for them. They are not religious, even though indulged
in by theologians; because religion is solely concerned
with the personal consciousness of our relation to God, and
the discharge of our personal duty to God, and not in the
remotest sense with any theory as to the method of causation
in the world around us. It is equally certain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
these speculations are not scientific, even though indulged
in by scientists; because science deals only with phenomena,
and the laws of phenomena; and it is a fundamental
canon of all scientific induction that no problem is to be
mooted unless it can be presented in terms of experience,
and no principles are to be admitted which can not be
verified by experiment. But the modern speculations respecting
the <i>origin</i> of motion, of life, and of mind can not
be presented in terms of sensible experience, and can not
be verified by actual experiment. So far as sensible experience
goes, every case of physical motion is a transformation
of energy, and every new physiological unit
or aggregation of units is derived from pre-existent bioplasm.
And so Dr. Tyndall, in the speculations in which
he indulges, in the now celebrated "Inaugural Address"
delivered at Belfast, particularly in regard to the origin
of life, admits that he "<i>oversteps the boundary of the experimental
evidence</i>;" therefore, by his own admission,
these speculations are <i>unscientific</i>.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> These discussions are
inevitable, and even valuable. We would protest as earnestly
as Dr. Tyndall against the attempt of any man to
set limits to human thought, but we would equally protest
against the attempt to pass off the results of speculative
thinking in any direction as "exact science." True science
is itself dishonored and discredited by all such attempts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>
<p>We have said that it is solely within the field of speculative
thought that all controversy has arisen concerning
the doctrine of special providence and the efficacy of
prayer. This will be apparent from the consideration
of the fact that from the dawn of speculative thought
to the present hour two radically opposite theories of
the origin of things have prevailed&mdash;one <i>mechanical</i>, the
other <i>vital</i>.</p>

<p>The vital theory regards nature as the product and the
continued work of an ever-living and ever-creating Spirit,
who is the immediate fountain of all force, and the immanent
life of all that lives. It looks upon the universe "as
the manifestation and the abode of a Free Mind like our
own," who realizes his thoughts in its collocations and adjustments,
embodies his ideals in its typical forms, and by
his free volition subordinates nature to the higher purposes
of intellectual and moral life&mdash;the formation of
noble human characters. In a world so constituted prayer
is a real power, and human character is a free development
through the power of prayer which influences that ever-present
Will that sustains our life.</p>

<p>The mechanical theory regards the world as a huge
machine supplied with motor power in the primal act of
creation, and then left to make its own history according
to rigid laws of mechanics and "the multiplication table."
There is no "Power which makes for righteousness," and
no purpose of love mingling in the necessary order of
things. Evolution is the only law of creation; there is
nothing spontaneous, nothing free. All the processes of
nature, all the forms of life, all the facts of consciousness,
all the sympathies, sacrifices, joys, and sorrows of social
life, and all the noble or ignoble deeds of history, are only
mechanical functions which can be weighed or measured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and catalogued in tables of statistics. Inflexible necessity,
inexorable law, absolute uniformity, unbroken continuity
tell the story of the universe. In such a world
there is no place for prayer, or at most it is but the cry of
anguish wrung from the lips of those who are being mangled
and crushed by the ponderous mechanism, which
floats away into the infinite spaces, and never finds a living
ear or touches a compassionate heart. Then, as Dr.
Hedge puts the melancholy case, "We must rough it as
best we can with driving-wheel and fly-wheel, and trust
that the power may not fail and the gearing foul in our
short day."</p>

<p>This is the position of some, but by no means of the
majority of the scientists of our time. We venture the assertion
that it is no part of the doctrine of modern science,
neither does it follow as a logical consequence from any
of the accepted principles of modern science, nor does it
reflect the real feeling of the best exponents of modern
science.</p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall stands as one of the most popular exponents
of scientific knowledge, and may be regarded as a
fair representative of the feelings of many scientific men.
And in his estimation "the problem of problems of our
day is to find a legitimate satisfaction for the religious
emotions." He admits that these religious emotions are
inexpugnable facts of human nature, as certain and as incontestable
as the facts of physics. Now what is meant
by a <i>legitimate</i> satisfaction of the religious emotions?
Does it not mean that human reverence must have a <i>real</i>
and a worthy Object? that for human duty there must be
an imperative ground of obligation? that for true loyalty
of soul to truth and right there must be an eternal reason?
and that the instinctive trust of the soul in everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
righteousness and everlasting love must have a rational
vindication? Where shall we look for this object? "May
we look upward and onward, or have we nothing to do
but yield to the pressure from behind and below?" What
conception are we to form of that mysterious Power or
Principle which stands in necessary correlation with the
religious nature of man? Dr. Tyndall permits us "to
fashion this conception as we will"&mdash;with that "he has
nothing to do;" only he demands that in doing so we observe
two conditions: 1. "Be careful that your conception
is not an unworthy one;" "invest it with your highest and
holiest thoughts." 2. Allow "no intrusion of purely creative
power into any series of phenomena," no arbitrary interference
with the order of nature "for special purposes."
The first condition would be violated by our conceiving
that Power as purely <i>mechanical</i>, for then the sublimest
interests of our moral and spiritual life would be
surrendered to the action of the same force as that which
draws a stone to the earth. The conception of unconscious
and unmoral force is not our highest and holiest thought&mdash;it
can not inspire reverence and loyalty and love. The
second condition would be violated by our regarding that
Power as <i>arbitrary</i>&mdash;that is, as following no law; for that
would be opposed to all the inductions of modern science,
and would invalidate all conclusions based on the assumed
permanence of natural laws. The problem, then, is to
steer between the Scylla and Charybdis of mechanism and
arbitrariness, and find the open sea where freedom may
move in harmony with law, and where, in the grand hierarchy
of laws the physical order of the world may be co-ordinated
with, perhaps subordinated to, the higher reign
of righteousness and love.</p>

<p>The solution of this problem can only be reached through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the discussion of the following questions: 1. What are
"the facts of religious feeling" involved in this problem,
and what are the necessary correlatives of these facts? 2.
What are the facts concerning the order of nature involved
in the problem, and what are the logical inferences
from these facts? 3. How can the conception of the <i>Force</i>
which is manifested in the phenomena of nature be brought
into harmony with the idea of <i>God</i> as revealed in the religious
consciousness?</p>

<p>1. First, then, what are the facts of religious feeling
which "as experiences of consciousness are perfectly beyond
the assaults of logic," and what are the necessary
correlatives of these facts?</p>

<p>We present first of all the incontestable fact that <i>prayer
is natural to</i> man. Like our instinctive belief in the being
of God, the accountability of man, and the immortality
of the soul, we have also an instinctive prompting to
pray, and an instinctive belief in the efficacy of prayer.
This is an essentially human characteristic; it is common
to all men. Man has been defined in many ways, as "a
rational animal," "a social animal," "a tool-using animal,"
"a language-speaking animal;" with more justice may he
be called "a <i>praying</i> animal," for prayer is a universal
characteristic and fundamental differentia of man. Never
has the traveler yet found a people which did not pray.
Tribes of men have been found without houses, without
raiment, without letters, without science, but never without
prayer any more than without speech. This was remarked
by Plutarch eighteen centuries ago,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and the researches
and explorations of modern travelers and ethnologists have
added confirmation to its truth. The flow of prayer from
human lips is just as natural as the flow of speech. Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
man in danger or in sorrow, his most natural and spontaneous
refuge is in prayer. The suffering, bewildered,
terror-stricken soul that knows not where to fly, flies to
God. There are few men, probably no men, who in moments
of extreme peril or intense anguish can resist the
impulse to pray. Nature is stronger than all our logic;
and, science or no science, the cry for help will rise from
the lips of even skeptical men.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>We ask that these facts may be fully considered and
fairly estimated. The instinctive tendency to pray is a
universal fact of human nature, as valid and as significant
as any fact in physics. It presents as rightful a claim to
be taken account of in our theories of the ultimate constitution
of the universe as the First Law of Motion or the
Conservation of Energy. If we disregard it, our <i>Systema
Mundi</i> will be one-sided and partial, and, instead of being
a philosophy, will be only a caricature.</p>

<p>We do not claim that the presence in man of this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>stinctive
tendency to pray proves the efficacy of prayer&mdash;that
is, proves the existence of a living God and Father
who hears and answers prayer. But it does establish a
strong presumption in favor of the doctrine; for how
comes it to pass that the sentiment is so perennial and
so universal? Either it was originally implanted in the
soul of man by the Creator, or there exists something in
the constitution of nature&mdash;the "relation between the organism
and its environment"&mdash;which determines this feeling
in man, and in either case it must be regarded as normal,
and as essential to humanity. If nature teaches us to
pray, and, as it were, compels us to pray, then we are justified
in the assumption that there is nothing in the ultimate
constitution of nature which can contradict her own ordinances
and render prayer an absurdity.</p>

<p>The next fact to which we desire to direct attention is that
<i>prayer is an essential element of life</i>&mdash;we do not mean
physical life, but that which gives significance and value
and completeness to human existence&mdash;namely, ethical and
spiritual life. That religion is deeply seated in the nature
of man, and, in fact, ineradicable, is conceded by Dr. Tyndall.
"No atheistical reasoning," he says, "can dislodge religion
from the heart of man. Logic can not deprive us
of life, and religion is life to the religious. As an experience
of consciousness, it is perfectly beyond the assaults of
logic."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> This general admission that man has a religious
nature, a religious consciousness, is important. The bearing
of this upon our argument will be obvious when we
have considered more particularly the nature and content
of this "religious consciousness." In what does it consist?
Into what elements is it resolvable by psychological analysis?
We answer, religious consciousness is a conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>ness
conditioned by the idea of God, and involves a sense
of dependence; a feeling of reverence; a sense of obligation;
a sentiment of loyalty; a conscious community of
nature; and a longing for a deeper fellowship with the
<i>Divine</i>.</p>

<p>Every thing around us and every thing within us makes
us conscious of limitation and dependence. We know
that our own existence is not self-originated or self-sustained.
We have the sense of an immanent all-pervading
Life which sustains and conditions our life. We have the
sentiment of an overshadowing Power and Presence which
compasses us behind and before, and lays its hand upon
us, and we are constrained to bow in reverence and awe
before that Power which controls our destiny. With the
sense of dependence is associated the feeling of obligation
to conform our conduct to the will of this Supreme Being,
and to subordinate the ruling purpose of our life to the
Divine purpose of creation so far as that purpose can be
known. There is also more or less loyalty of soul to what
is just and true, a natural and constitutional sympathy
of reason with the law of God&mdash;"it delights in that law,"
and "consents that it is good." Finally, there is the consciousness
of some community of nature between God and
man, and some living susceptibility to the influences and
inspirations of the higher world which authorizes the belief
that there may be a communion of thought, a relation
of conscience, and an approach of affection between the Divine
and human that shall purify and elevate our nature,
and lift us up into a resemblance to God.</p>

<p>The bearing of all that we have just said on the necessity
of prayer will have already suggested itself to the
reader. The feeling of dependence, the sense of feebleness
will prompt man to pray. Man is not sufficient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
himself. He is not fit to be his own all in all. He has
not resources within himself to supply his own spiritual
wants. He needs some external succor, some support to
the will, some inspiration from without. And he can become
a strong man and a noble man only by aspiring and
striving after something beyond and above himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unless above himself he can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erect himself, how mean a thing is man!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When his affections and cares and thoughts all centre
upon himself, his soul shrivels down to a dreary selfishness,
and becomes a dry microscopic point, or else a mass of
putrid sensuality. Man needs a lofty object above himself,
after which he may aspire and upon which he may
lay hold and lift himself into a nobler form of life. That
lofty object is the ideal of a <i>perfect, noble human character</i>.
"The formation of noble human character," says
Mr. Murphy, "is the highest work that man or, so far as
we know, that God can be engaged in."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The thoughtful
mind recognizes that there is a purpose to be fulfilled in
life which is nobler than mere enjoyment. Who has dared
to say that our highest duty is to be happy? But every
one must feel that it is our highest duty to form a nobler
character and let the happiness take care of itself.</p>

<p>And now is it not a fact of experience that the more a
man strives after a pure and noble life, the more does he
become conscious of the need of superhuman strength and
grace? He finds that he has to wage an uncompromising,
sometimes even agonizing warfare against hereditary
"taints of blood," against morbid instincts and low passions,
against inherent selfishness and meanness, against
tyrant habits engendered in the recklessness of youth,
against the temptations of designing men and abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
women, and the false sentiment, despotic opinion, and arbitrary
customs of modern fashionable society. In the
presence of these giants of evil with their fetters of iron
he stands appalled, and against himself, against his temptations
and sins, even against society itself, he feels he
must <i>call upon God for help</i>. Through Divine strength
he may conquer; without it&mdash;never. There are those who
hope to conquer evil through a certain inherent force of
nature, or a certain self-caused and self-attained culture.
We do not dare to say that they will utterly fail, or that
what they achieve is utterly valueless. But we do say that
the character they develop is not the highest style of excellence.
There is in it a boldness bordering on audacity,
a self-sufficiency akin to haughtiness, and an arbitrariness
which is repulsive. The very basis of a noble character,
the very essence of that prophetic power which has exerted
the mightiest influence on the destinies of man, is humility.
The loftiest and finest minds have been eminently
trustful&mdash;men of heroic confidence who derived their inspiration
and confessed their dependence on the light and
strength which come from above. These are the men who
really shape the history of the world,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> these are the men
who command the esteem and win the reverence even of
unbelievers. We can not illustrate this point better than
by quoting the words of Dr. Tyndall in regard to Michael
Faraday. Faraday, it is well known, was one of the greatest
of modern scientists&mdash;it ought also to be as widely
known that he was a devout Christian. Tyndall dined
with Faraday, and on that occasion Faraday "said grace."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p>Tyndall writes: "I am almost ashamed to call his prayer a
'saying' of grace. In the language of Scripture, it might
be described as the petition of a son into whose heart God
had sent the Spirit of his Son, and who, with absolute trust,
asked a blessing from his father. We dined on roast beef,
Yorkshire pudding, and potatoes; drank sherry, talked of
research and its requirements, and of his habit of keeping
himself free from the distractions of society. He was
bright and joyful&mdash;boylike, in fact&mdash;though he is now
sixty-two. His work excites my admiration, but contact
with him warms my heart. Here surely is a <i>strong</i> man.
I love strength, but let me not forget the example of its
union with <i>modesty</i>, <i>tenderness</i>, and <i>sweetness</i> in the character
of Faraday."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>This, then, is the point we desire to emphasize. It is a
fact of experience that prayer can give calmness, purity,
and strength of soul. It can lighten perplexity and sorrow.
It can empower us to resist temptation, and enable
us to overcome sin. It can give "modesty, tenderness,
and sweetness" to character. In a word, it can aid us
materially in the formation of a noble human character.</p>

<p>Noble character can only be formed under two conditions.
First, it can only be formed under the condition
of <i>freedom</i>. The unfree is the unmoral.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> There can
be no dignity and no moral worth in action which results
from mere mechanical force. Personality alone has
responsibility, dignity, and worth. If, then, moral personality
has true freedom and self-determination, we are free to
pray, and God is free to answer prayer. We may believe
that the physical world is held in iron bands of necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
causation, but we can not believe that the moral world is
so bound. The human will is free, and the Divine will
is free. "The First Cause," says Mr. Spencer, "includes
within itself all power"&mdash;therefore alternative power&mdash;"and
transcends all law"&mdash;therefore it can not be necessitated.
We can not doubt that Mr. Tyndall would freely
accord this position. He might hesitate, he would unquestionably
refuse to unite in "prayer for rain," for example,
because he holds that the fall of rain is governed by
changeless physical laws, and "no act of humiliation, individual
or national, could call one shower from heaven;"
this would be a miracle, and "the age of miracles is past."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
But we do not see how he could refuse to unite in the prayers
of the National Church for the forgiveness of sins, for
strength to overcome sin, for fortitude to endure, and for
consolation under the afflictions and sorrows incident to
human life.</p>

<p>The second condition necessary to the development of
noble character is that man shall be capable of receiving inspiration
from the great source of all life, especially of all
spiritual life. The universal belief of our race that there
is a community of nature between God and man, expressed
alike in the words of Aratus, the Asiatic poet, Cleanthes,
the Stoic philosopher, and Paul, the Christian teacher&mdash;"<i>We
are the offspring of God</i>"&mdash;justifies the further expectation
and hope that there may be a real communion between
the human and the Divine. Of course this is fundamentally
"a question between Theism and Atheism, between
a God and no God," between a conscious Being and an
unconscious Force. If there is a personal God, then He
may communicate with our souls which dwell, as it were,
within the ocean of his immensity, and are surrounded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
interpenetrated by his living presence. Then there may
be a real sympathy, a loving fellowship, and a sanctifying
communion. Even should science forbid the Author of
nature to interpose in the slightest degree in the procession
of phenomena or modify in the least the action of the
so-called natural forces, surely it will not be so "audacious"<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
as to forbid that He shall come near to human
souls, and interpose in the moral order of the world to deliver
man from sin and purify and elevate human society.
Here at any rate science is out of its place. It is guilty
of that very presumption with which it is evermore charging
the theology of the Middle Ages, viz., the attempt to
monopolize the whole field of human knowledge and experience.
If the good man does feel that God is with him
and in him, if he knows by experience that prayer is an
act of Divine communion&mdash;that it opens to him an unfailing
fountain of refreshment, solace, and strength; if he is
conscious that it does lift him up to a larger and more
blessed life, then even science, which boasts its rigid adherence
to the inductive method, and its unswerving loyalty
to fact and experience, must obey the Divine injunction&mdash;"Be
still, and know that I am God." "I dwell with
him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the
spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite."</p>

<p>2. We come now to the consideration of the second
question, What are the facts concerning the order of nature
which have been placed beyond controversy by the
inductions of science, and what are the logical inferences
from these facts?</p>

<p>The facts concerning the order of nature which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
claimed are placed beyond controversy may be stated in
the following words: Now of all the results of science,
none is more universal and more emphatic than this: that
there is no arbitrariness in the series of events which constitute
our experience; but that a perfect order or uniformity
prevails through them all, an order which our intellect
can apprehend under the form of cause and effect, or <i>permanent</i>
force and <i>necessary</i> phenomena, or, better, a constant
persistency of amount both of matter and force in
the universe.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> This statement of the scientist is accepted
by many theologians (of the Calvinistic school), who
say with Rev. William Knight, "The doctrine of the persistence
of physical force and the invariability of natural
law, is a physical truth of which the theological phase or
corollary is the uniformity of Divine operation and the
inviolableness of Divine love. 'The permanence of the
order of nature' is the scientific equivalent of the Divine
constancy&mdash;'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'"<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
How far and in what sense we accept this doctrine will
be seen as we advance in the discussion.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this chapter we remarked that
if the Christian doctrine of the efficacy of prayer is disputed,
whether on <i>theoretical</i> or <i>experiential</i> grounds,
an adequate and complete defense can only be made by
falling back upon the fundamental conception of God,
and the relation of God to nature and humanity presented
in the preceding chapters of this volume. Is there a God
in the proper and commonly accepted sense of the term&mdash;a
conscious, free, personal First Cause, the Creator of the
world and man? Is He the immanent Conservator of the
universe&mdash;is his omnipotence the <i>force</i>, his reason the <i>law</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and his omnipresence the <i>life</i> of all nature? These are
the questions which must be settled before we can successfully
deal with the problem of the efficacy of prayer.
If we are not agreed on these points, the debate must
be adjourned until we have settled the first principles
which underlie the discussion. This will be obvious to
all who are acquainted with the history of the controversy.
If it can be proved that there is no conscious,
free, personal God, the creator and conservator of the
universe, the question is settled; then prayer can be of
no avail, and must "be abandoned to the domain of recognized
superstitions." But if it be admitted that there
is a God, in the proper import of that term, then the question
may be debated whether the Christian doctrine of
the efficacy of prayer is consistent with the scientific
conception of material nature as "the living garment
of God."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall is the fairest and ablest representative of
that class of scientific men who to-day are denying the efficacy
of prayer&mdash;that is, of such prayer the answer to which
would seem to involve the interference of personal volition
in the economy of nature; and he believes in the existence
of a God. He has again and again repelled with feeling
the imputation of atheism which the English theologians
have inconsiderately and unfairly cast upon him. He is a
frank, outspoken man, and he admits that in "his hours of
weakness and doubt" he has temptations to material atheism.
"But," he says, "I have noticed that it is not in
hours of clearness and vigor that this doctrine commends
itself to my mind, and that in presence of stronger and
healthier thoughts it ever disappears as offering no solution
of the mystery in which we dwell and of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
form a part."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> He also expresses his conviction that "the
Power which works for righteousness is <i>intelligent</i> as well
as ethical."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> And furthermore he asserts that "it is no
departure from scientific method to place behind natural
phenomena <i>a universal Father</i> who, in answer to the prayers
of his children, alters the currents of those phenomena.
Thus far theology and science go hand in hand."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
Let it, then, be distinctly remembered that we are arguing
with men who believe in the existence of God.</p>

<p>In an article which appeared in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>
for August, 1872, entitled "Statistical Inquiries into
the Efficacy of Prayer," by Francis Galton, a species of
guerrilla warfare is opened on this doctrine from the stand-point
of experience.</p>

<p>Mr. Galton assumes that "the efficacy of prayer is a perfectly
appropriate and legitimate subject of scientific inquiry."
It must be assumed to be subject to unvarying
laws, and, like all physical problems, may be brought to
the test of rigid mathematics. By the marshaling of very
incomplete and partial statistics, drawn chiefly from Chalmers's
"Biographical Dictionary," he endeavors to show
that praying men, especially clergymen, are no healthier,
recover from sickness no better, and do not live any longer
than the men who do not pray. Insurance companies
make no distinction between the prayerful and the prayerless;
they regard them as equal risks. Furthermore, praying
men do not make any better statesmen, any more successful
men of business, or any better physicians and lawyers
than prayerless men. On the contrary, "it is a common
week-day opinion of the world that praying men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
not practical." Finally, the children of praying parents
are no better endowed intellectually, and do not turn out
any better morally than the rest of mankind. His gentle
impeachment is that they are somewhat below the common
average. By this "scientific method," as he is pleased to
call it, the writer flatters himself that he has routed the
army of believers in the efficacy of prayer, and that the
practice of prayer will soon become "obsolete;" "just
as the Water of Jealousy and the Urim and Thummmin of
the Mosaic law did in the times of the later Jewish kings."</p>

<p>But Mr. Galton's fusillade did not produce the effect he
expected. True, it made some noise, and for a brief season
commanded attention; but it was soon discovered to
be a mere discharge of rhetorical blank-cartridge which
hit nothing. His parade of argument was found to be
utterly inconsequential. The dullest mind could perceive
that the attempt to solve moral problems by statistical
averages was a practical folly, because it began by unceremoniously
assuming the very point it ought to prove,
namely, that <i>the determinations of will, whether Divine
or human, are governed by necessary laws</i> as surely as the
revolution of planets and the vibration of molecules. It
is precisely because personal acts are <i>not</i> reducible to any
fixed laws, or capable of representation by any numerical
calculations, that statistical averages acquire any value as
substitutes. "No one dreams of applying statistical averages
to calculate the period of the earth's rotation, by
showing that four and twenty hours is the exact medium
of time, comparing one month's or one year's revolutions
with another's. It is only where the individual movements
are irregular that it is necessary to aim at a proximate
regularity by calculating in masses."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>parison
of large averages may approach equality and furnish
a basis of probability as to the future, but the contingency
of each individual case remains still a contingency.</p>

<p>In no department of human inquiry is there so much
temptation and so much opportunity for plausible sophistry
as in the now somewhat popular application of statistics
to ethological problems. By a skillful manipulation
of figures, Mr. Buckle<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> flatters himself that he has made it
apparent that "individual felons only carry into effect the
necessary consequences of preceding circumstances;" that
marriages are regulated by the price of wheat; and that
the number of suicides is determined by the rise and fall
of the barometer; in a word, that the whole of man's social
and moral life is part and parcel of nature, and subject
to the same necessary mechanical laws.</p>

<p>The logic of statistics, or rather the sophistry of statistics
by which Mr. Galton proves the uselessness of prayer,
would, if skillfully managed, be equally efficacious in proving
that sobriety and integrity, honor and honesty, are unprofitable
and useless virtues&mdash;at least so far as this life is
concerned; and we might say of each of them what Shakespeare's
"Murderer" says of conscience: "It fills one full
of obstacles.... It beggars any man that keeps it. It is
turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust
himself, and live without it." Dishonest men are as
healthy, recover as well from sickness, and live as long as
honest men. Wicked men prosper in the world, they succeed
in business and increase in riches better, it may be,
than good and godly men. Dishonorable and unprincipled
politicians climb into place and power with more facility
than men of honor and integrity. Distinguished lawyers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and skillful physicians have not been strictly temperate;
and statistical tables may be easily produced which show
that the longest-lived men have been such as did not go to
bed sober for the last fifty years of their lives. Therefore
sobriety, honesty, integrity, veracity are not profitable virtues,
and, weighed in the same scales and by the same
standards as are used by Mr. Galton to test the weight and
worth of prayer, they are practically valueless and do not
pay.</p>

<p>Simultaneous with Mr. Galton's article, there appeared
a communication in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> entitled
"The Prayer for the Sick: Hints toward a serious attempt
to estimate its value," with the indorsement of Dr. Tyndall.
The proposal contained in this communication came
to be generally known in newspaper slang as "Tyndall's
Prayer-gauge," though Tyndall was not its author. The
proposition was that "One single ward or hospital under
the care of first-rate physicians or surgeons, containing a
number of patients afflicted with those diseases which have
been best studied, and of which the mortality rates are best
known, should be, during a period of not less than three to
five years, made the subject of special prayer by the whole
body of the faithful, and that at the end of that period the
mortality rates should be compared with the past rates,
and also with those of other leading hospitals similarly
well managed during the same periods." This experiment,
the writer thinks, offers "to the faithful an occasion
of demonstrating to the faithless an imperishable record
of the power of prayer."</p>

<p>There was a tone of moderation and candor in this proposition
which for a moment beguiled the popular mind,
and there were Christian ministers so injudicious as to admit
that the proposal should be entertained and the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>periment
tried. But its superficial fairness was delusive,
and its plausibility concealed a snare. The writer must
have been sufficiently conversant with the Christian doctrine
concerning prayer to know that the acceptance of
his challenge would be a theological blunder; for there
are no unconditional assurances in the Word of God that
prayers for health and long life shall always be answered.
We presume also that he must have been sufficiently acquainted
with medical science to perceive that the acceptance
of his challenge would be a scientific blunder, for
there are elements in the problem which can not be scientifically
appreciated, measured, and recorded. Such, for
example, are the temperament, idiosyncrasy, hereditary
diathesis, previous habits of life, and mental characteristics
of the patients; such the variety in skill, care, sympathy,
and almost inspiration among physicians and nurses;
such also the differences of climatal, sanitary, and hospital
conditions; all these elements, whose varied degrees of
potency are incapable of being estimated, enter into the
problem and affect the results. The multiplicity and complexity
of these elements render the effects as irregularly
variable as if each cause had not been subject to any previous
conditions.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> The problem is not even capable of
being scientifically presented in terms of experience, and
until that is done it can not be subjected to experiment.
Suppose the experiment to be tried in the manner proposed
by the writer, and the mortality rates to be in favor
of the hospital for which prayer had been offered, it would
still be open for the scientific skeptic to affirm that the
causes of the difference are to be found in those elements
whose varying values had not been enumerated in the
statement of the problem, and not in any Divine interpo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>sition
in answer to prayer.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> He might claim that the patients
were not all of the same age or temperament, the
physicians were not all of equal skill, the nurses were not
all alike attentive, the climatal and sanitary conditions
were not equal, and the question would be left in precisely
the same condition as before.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the award of a thoughtless derision,
we do not hesitate in saying that the proposition is an improper
one, and can not be entertained. Especially because
there is one party concerned in this matter for whom
no human being is authorized to make any engagements,
and that is "the Hearer and Answerer of Prayer." There
is only one class of blessings for which He has given us
any warrant to pray unconditionally, and these are <i>spiritual</i>
blessings. For strength to resist temptation, to endure
affliction, and perform well our appointed work in life;
for grace to purify our nature, elevate our aims, conquer
our selfishness and pride, and help us to form a noble character,
God has authorized and commanded us to pray.
But for the blessings of this life, for deliverance from
danger and suffering, for restoration from sickness and for
long life, we are taught to pray in submission to that highest
wisdom which knows what is best for us, and to append
to every supplication, however ardent our desire and
intense our solicitude, "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as
Thou wilt." This submission is the loftiest attitude of
prayer.</p>

<p>At the same time we shrink not from the distinct avowal
of the Christian doctrine that it is reasonable and prop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>er
to offer prayer for recovery from sickness, and that such
prayer, offered in submission to the Divine will, may be
answered. We are not ashamed of the good old faith&mdash;"the
Aberglaube," or superstition, as some are pleased to
call it&mdash;that "<i>the prayer of faith shall save the sick</i>."
The calmness and serenity of mind which the prayer of
faith supplies is favorable to recovery. In fact, as "the
systematic excitation of a definite expectation and hope,"
it has a legitimate place in psycho-therapeutics, as Feuchtersleben
has shown, and even as Dr. Tuke concedes in
his work on the "Influence of the Mind on the Body."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
This "definite expectation and hope" is not a mere illusion.
We have the assurance of Scripture that there is a
Divine blessing which "giveth wisdom to the wise and
knowledge to men of understanding," and which may descend
upon the head and the heart of the most skillful
physician in answer to prayer. Furthermore, it is generally
admitted by medical men that "as in health certain
mental states may induce disease, so in disease certain
mental states may restore health."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Now these "mental
states" may be the subject of Divine influence. Science
has not dared to shut out the Spirit of God from the realm
of mind, and therefore restoration to health may be given,
in this manner at least, in answer to prayer. But no man
would propose to make the prevalence of such prayer the
subject of statistical averages. Prayer for the sick can not
always result in their recovery, for then they would never
die. Our lives are in the hands of God, and we shall live
until our work is done, or until we have clearly shown
that we will not do our work, and our life is a failure and
a defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, in the name of our holy religion, we repel with
scorn the attempt of certain scientists to test the value of
prayer, and with it also the value of a life of self-denial,
purity, and piety, by merely temporal, secular, and visible
results which may be weighed and measured and set
down in statistical tables. Christianity teaches that the
present life is a probationary scene. It is a state of trial
and discipline with a view to the formation of moral character.
Therefore our principles and our virtues must be
put to the test. Temptation tries our fortitude; affliction
ascertains our submission; suffering purifies our souls;
doubt and mystery give energy to our faith. Amid the
good and the evil of the present our character has to be
developed and perfected. There is much to be encountered,
much to be endured. But as Richard Winter Hamilton
has said, "This discipline is salutary. The furnace
heat purities the gold by its rigorous assay. The vine
prunes until it bleeds that it may bear its richer clusters.
A theatre is raised for lofty struggle and celestial
dint." The end of all is to make us pure and noble and
heroic souls.</p>

<p>The scientists of this age, who are so enamored of inert
matter and insensate force, may have no eye to see, no
heart to sympathize with, and no competent faculty by
which to estimate the value of this blessed vintage; but
there are souls to whom honor is dearer than life, and wisdom
more precious than rubies, and purity more desirable
than fine gold, who will continue to pray&mdash;"Cleanse the
thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit,
that we may perfectly love Thee and worthily magnify
thy holy name."</p>

<p>So much for the argument against the efficacy of prayer
from the experiential stand-point. We are compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
pronounce it a failure. There seems good reason to believe
that Dr. Tyndall regards it as a failure, for we do not find
that he any where denies the efficacy of prayer for spiritual
blessings. But, like a second Ajax Telemon, he makes
haste to interpose his ample shield for the defense of his
unfortunate friends; he is careful, however, to change the
entire mode of warfare, and he opens the attack on the
efficacy of prayer from the <i>theoretical</i> stand-point.</p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall begins by observing that "the idea of direct
personal volition mixing itself in the economy of nature
is retreating more and more" in presence of advancing
science, and among educated and scientific communities
there is a growing conviction that "nature is absolutely
uniform," and that her laws are changeless and
permanent. He takes the ground that all prayer for Divine
interposition "to produce changes in external nature,"
such, for example, as "prayer for rain or for fair
weather," is irrational, because the answer to such prayer
would be "a violation of the order of nature," "a manifest
contradiction to natural laws," and in fact "a <i>miracle</i>."
"The dispersion of the slightest mist by the special
volition of the Eternal would be as great a miracle ...
as the stoppage of an eclipse or the rolling of the St. Lawrence
up the Falls of Niagara. No act of humiliation, individual
or national, could call one shower from heaven or
deflect toward us a single beam of the sun."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>We have characterized this attack of Dr. Tyndall's as an
attack on the efficacy of prayer from the <i>theoretical</i> stand-point:
1. Because he does not claim that the belief in the
changeless uniformity of nature is a <i>self-evident</i> truth&mdash;a
direct intuition, either of sense or of reason, which needs
no proof. 2. Because he does not assert that the absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
uniformity of nature has been <i>inductively</i> proved, or is
even capable of verification by experience, since all experience,
whether of the individual or the race, is necessarily
limited, and can not, therefore, give a universal truth. All
that he can say of it is that it is "an <i>assumption</i>"&mdash;an
assumption which all carefully conducted experiments
have justified, and upon which all successful scientific research
has been based. The majestic fabric of modern
science has been reared upon this foundation.</p>

<p>But mark, it is still "<i>an assumption</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and the central
question around which the battle must be fought is, <i>What
ground have we for the assumption that the order of
nature is so absolutely persistent and changeless that it
never has been and never can be interfered with by an act
of intelligent volition?</i></p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall has attempted an answer to this question.
We shall endeavor, first, clearly to comprehend his answer,
and, secondly, to estimate its logical validity.</p>

<p>1. He tells us that the belief in a changeless order of
nature "is a kind of inspiration." "The passage from
facts to principles (that is, the passage from our limited
experience of uniformity to the affirmation of universal
and permanent order) is called induction, which in its
highest form is inspiration."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> This, however, is poetry,
and not science. This inductive inference embraces vastly
more in the conclusion than is contained in the premises;
the antecedent is limited, the consequent is unlimited;
and the only warrant that Dr. Tyndall has for the
violation of the most fundamental logical canon is "inspiration."
But, whatever Dr. Tyndall may understand
by this ambiguous phrase, it is certain that his own mind
is not satisfied, and so he tries again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>2. He tells us that this belief rests upon the long-continued
observations, registered experiences, and experimental
verifications of a succession of scientific men, as
Galileo, Torricelli, Pascal, Kepler, and Newton. But here
again the experiences are limited, and do not justify a
universal conclusion; and Dr. Tyndall himself is not satisfied.
He says, "The scientific mind can find no repose
in the mere registration of sequences in nature. The
further question obtrudes itself with resistless might,
<i>Whence come the sequences?</i> What is it that binds the
consequent with the antecedent in nature?" What is it,
we ask with redoubled earnestness and emphasis, which
authorizes our drawing a universal conclusion from particular
premises? "The truly scientific intellect never
can attain rest until it reaches the <span class="smcap">FORCES</span> by which the
observed succession is produced.... Not until the relation
between the forces and the phenomena has been established
is the <i>law of the reason</i> rendered concentric with
the <i>law of nature</i>, and not until this is effected does the
mind of the scientific philosopher rest in peace."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Here
we have "the law of the reason" substituted for "the
highest form of inspiration," and we are curious to learn
what this "law of the reason" is. Is it the principle, or
law of causality&mdash;namely, that "all phenomena present
themselves to us as the expression of <i>power</i>, and refer us
to a causal ground?" But this law of the reason says
nothing about uniformity. The same power may produce
a diversity of effects. "Infinitely numerous and various
universes might have been fashioned by the various distribution
of the original nebulous matter, although the
particles of matter should obey the one law of gravity."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>3. And, finally, Dr. Tyndall tells us that "The expectation
of likeness [<i>i. e.</i>, uniformity] in the procession of phenomena
is not that on which the scientific mind founds
its belief in the order of nature. If the force is <i>permanent</i>,
the phenomena are <i>necessary</i> whether they resemble
or do not resemble any thing that has gone before. Hence
in judging of the order of nature our inquiry eventually
relates to the permanence of force,"<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> or, as he elsewhere
styles it, "the conservation of energy," which means "that
no power can make its appearance in nature without an
equivalent expenditure of some other power; that natural
agents are so related as to be mutually convertible,
but that no new agency is created."<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Whether this is
or is not a correct statement of the principle of the conservation
of energy we shall see by and by. And now,
after having hunted the game through many tortuous passages
to its final burrow, what have we found? That the
ultimate principle which justifies the belief or "assumption"
that the laws of nature are so rigidly inflexible and
the order of nature is so absolutely uniform that "personal
volition can not mingle in or interfere with the economy
of nature" <i>is the principle of the conservation of energy</i>.
</p>

<p>The answer of Dr. Tyndall is now fully and clearly before
our mental view, and we are prepared for the consideration
of its logical validity. This answer may be conveniently
divided into two propositions. First, personal
volition, human or Divine, can not intermingle or in any
way interfere with the economy of nature because her
laws are inflexible and her order is uniform. Second,
the ultimate principle which justifies the assumption that
the laws of nature are absolutely inflexible and the order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
of nature is absolutely uniform is the principle of the conservation
of energy. We shall consider this latter proposition
first.</p>

<p>There are in this proposition three ambiguous terms,
which have hitherto been the source of serious misapprehension;
and unless we can attain to clearer and more
definite conceptions, which shall be mutually accepted, the
controversy will be interminable. These are the terms
"nature," "laws of nature," and "uniformity of the order
of nature." We have made the attempt in a previous
chapter<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> to give precision and definiteness to the concepts
which these terms should connote. Referring the reader
to the chapter indicated, we shall here simply restate our
results.</p>

<p>1. <i>Nature</i> is the aggregate or totality of all material or
physical phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> "Nature (<i>nascor</i>, to be born) means
that which is produced or born."<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>A Law of Nature</i> is the statement of a certain uniformity
observed in the relations among phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> The
laws of nature are "simply expressions of phenomenal
uniformities, having no <i>coercive</i> power whatever."<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>The Uniformity of the Order of Nature</i> may mean
either "uniformity of co-existence" or "uniformity of
succession." "Uniformity of co-existence" means that
the same substances must always have the same essential
properties<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and the same permanent relations to other sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>stances,
as, for example, every molecule of hydrogen must
have the same properties, the same definite mass, the same
periodic vibrations, and the same chemical affinities. If
these were to be altered in the least, it would no longer be
a molecule of hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> This is uniformity in the ultimate
<i>constitution</i> of nature. "Uniformity of succession"
means that the same or similar consequents will always be
found to follow similar antecedents, or "the same causes
will always be followed by the same effects,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> as, for example,
the combination of carbon and oxygen will always be
followed by the evolution of heat, and heat will always
melt ice." This is uniformity in the <i>course</i> of nature or
the procession of phenomena. Belief in the constancy of
the course of nature or the uniformity of causation is the
general expectation that "the future will resemble the
past."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>With a clearer apprehension of the terms, we may now
discuss the first proposition with more precision, and hope
to reach a logical conclusion. We approach the discussion
by remarking&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The constancy of the <i>course</i> of nature or the uniformity
of causation is not a self-evident and necessary truth.
In so far as it is a scientific truth it is purely an induction
from experience, an experience which is necessarily limited,
and therefore does not warrant a universal conclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>sion.
There is no rational <i>à priori</i> ground for the assumption
that the same or similar causes (even if we understand
by physical causes all antecedent conditions) shall
necessarily produce the same effects. In other words,
there is no authority for the assertion that the course of
nature or the procession of phenomena must be absolutely
uniform. Science has succeeded in establishing a strong
probability, but it is beyond her power to demonstrate an
absolute certainty. This is generally conceded, alike by
physicists and metaphysicians. J. S. Mill says, "The uniformity
in the course of events ... must be received, not
as a law of the universe, but of that portion of it which is
within the range of our means of observation, with a reasonable
degree of extension to adjacent cases."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> "The
uniformity of causation," says Murphy, "is not a truth of
the reason, it is known by experience only; and the truth
of a conclusion from experience can never be free from
all possibility of limitation or exception."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> And Professor
Jevons asserts, "The conclusions of scientific inference
appear to be always of a hypothetical and purely provisional
nature. Given certain experience, the theory of
probability yields us the true interpretation of that experience,
and is the surest guide open to us. But the best
calculated results which it can give us are never absolute
probabilities: they are purely relative to the extent of our
information. It seems to be impossible for us to judge
how far our experience gives us adequate information of
the universe as a whole, and of all the forces and phenomena
which can have place therein."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>2. It is an immediate fact of consciousness that the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
is a cause which is adequate to the production of a diversity
of effects. Whatever may be true of the world of
matter, it is certain that within the sphere of our conscious
personality the relation of cause and effect is not a relation
of invariable and necessary sequence. Further, it is
certain that a self-determining agent exists. "Every event
in the universe of matter is determined by the events which
precede it, but physical reasonings make it certain that the
chain of causes and effects can not have been of absolutely
endless length through past time. There must have been
a first link of the chain; there must have been a first act
of causation; and this act must have been determined, not
by any previous act of causation when as yet there was
none, but by the free self-determining power of the agent.
The first act of causation we call Creation; the freely
self-determining agent we call God."<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>3. Physical science itself does not teach that the course
of nature is absolutely uniform; on the contrary, all the
conclusions of science lead to the conviction "that the
universe is ever changing, and that, notwithstanding secular
recurrences which would <i>primâ facie</i> seem to replace
matter in its original position, nothing in fact ever returns
or can return to a state of existence <i>identical</i> with a previous
state."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Every theory of the origin of things is
compelled to assume that an innate tendency to <i>variability</i>
is a fundamental fact of nature. This is made apparent
by the reasoning in Spencer's chapters on "The Instability
of the Homogeneous" and "The Multiplication
of Effects."<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The advocates of Natural Selection are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
emphatic in the assertion of this "Law of Variation," as
the cardinal fact upon which turns their doctrine of the
origin of species, and the whole system on which organic
life has been developed from the lowest to the highest
forms.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> "There is," says Comte, "an irregular variability of
effect engendered by the great number of different agents
determining at the same time the same phenomena [meteorological,
social, and vital], from which it results in
the most complicated phenomena that <i>there are not two
cases precisely alike</i>." "The multiplicity [of the agents]
renders the effects as irregularly variable as if every cause
had not been subjected to any previous conditions."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Dr.
Tyndall himself is in fact compelled to surrender the
doctrine of uniformity in the succession of phenomena.
He says "if the force be permanent, the phenomena are
necessary whether they <i>resemble</i> or do not resemble
any thing that has gone before."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> But if the phenomena
do not resemble any thing that has gone before,
how can there be "uniformity" in the succession of phenomena?</p>

<p>4. The uniformity of the <i>constitution</i> of material nature,
or the principle that the same substances must always
have the same essential properties, is undoubtedly a self-evident
and necessary truth, an <i>à priori</i>, rational intuition.
It is simply a statement in concrete form of the principle
or law of identity (A = A, or A is not equal to non-A).
As we have already observed, a substance which ceases to
have the same essential properties ceases to be the same
substance; for substances are only known to us through
their properties. But this "uniformity of co-existence" is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
distinct from "uniformity of succession," and we can not
infer the latter from the former. Admitting that the
same substance must always have the same properties, we
can not affirm that the same substances will always be collocated
in the same manner, or distributed in space with
the same uniformity. In fact, "we can discover nothing
regular in the distribution of matter through space; we
can reduce it to no uniformity, to no law."<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Matter is
never replaced in its original position; "nothing repeats
itself, because nothing can be placed in the same conditions;
the past is irrevocable."<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>Even should we say with Sir William Thomson that "motion
constitutes the very essence of what is commonly called
matter," still we know with infallible certainty that there
must be a <i>something</i> that moves, and that this something
which moves must have ultimately a definite <i>mass</i> (inertia)
and a measurable <i>velocity</i>, and that the <i>energy of motion</i>
to which the power of doing work is due is proportionate
to the mass multiplied into the square of the velocity.
Matter, then, is something more than motion.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> We know
further that there are different "modes of motion"&mdash;transitive,
rotatory, vibratory, pulsatory, gyratory&mdash;and that
these are undergoing perpetual transformation or conversion
one into the other. And, finally, we know that the
quantities of visible molar energy, and of invisible molecular
energy (as heat, light, electricity, magnetism), are not
uniform; on the contrary, the quantity of mechanical energy
is being continually dissipated&mdash;that is, transformed
into radiant heat, "which may be compared to the waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>heap
of the universe,"<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> and uniformly diffused heat will
not yield a single unit of work.</p>

<p>The principle of the conservation of energy is therefore
subject to limitations which are supplied by the principle
of the dissipation of energy. It simply asserts that,
so far as our observation extends, the whole amount of
potential and kinetic energy in the universe is invariable,
but it can not determine whether the amount of vital force,
or of psychic force, is invariable; and it is certainly incompetent
to fix a limitation to the exercise of Creative
Power. "It is nothing more than an intelligent and well-supported
denial of the chimera of perpetual motion, and
that a machine can no more create work than it can create
matter."<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> In the words of Grove, we can not conceive of
the production of any new force in the universe "<i>without
the interposition of Creative Power</i>."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall, in his solicitude to exclude all Divine interposition
in the economy of nature, has stated the law of
the conservation of energy in a form quite different from
that of his scientific brethren. He says, "The principle
of conservation is, <i>no creation</i> but infinite conversion;"<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
and he seems desirous to convey the impression that any
interposition of God to answer prayer would be a creation
of physical force, and as much a miracle as the rolling of
the waters of the St. Lawrence up the Falls of Niagara.
Dr. Tyndall does not here display his usual fairness and
candor. Surely he would not assert that the qualitative
and quantitative combination of the different natural agents&mdash;such
as light, heat, electricity, elasticity of vapors, and
aerial currents&mdash;which determine the fall of a shower of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
rain, would be a <i>creation</i> of energy; or that the disposition
of the meteorological, physical, chemical, vital, and
psychical conditions which result in the cure of the sick,
would be as much a miracle as "the stoppage of an
eclipse;" for these natural agents are more or less under
the control of man. But suppose it were granted that all
interposition of God in the economy of nature must be regarded
as <i>miraculous</i>, would he deny the possibility of
miracles even if they should involve a creation of energy?
Because we can not by any of our mechanical arrangements
create energy, does it therefore follow that God can
not create energy? Dr. Tyndall will not say this. "If
you ask who is to limit the outgoings of Almighty power,
my answer is&mdash;not I."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen presently that Dr. Tyndall admits that
the interference of personal volition in the economy of
nature is not forbidden by the law of the conservation of
energy. The point we now insist upon is that he has not
succeeded in showing that this principle is an absolute and
universal law of nature. We have already seen that it is
limited and conditioned by the law of the dissipation of
energy, and that in reality "it is merely a kind of <i>movable
equilibrium</i> between supply and destruction."<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> By
no experimental evidence has it been shown that it holds
true in the realm of vital dynamics and psycho-dynamics.
There are able scientific men who question its absolute
certainty even in the realm of physics. Professor Brooke
says that "the amount of energy in the world is unchanged,
the sum of the actual or kinetic and potential
energies being a constant quantity has been by some writers
overstrained. It may be taken as a postulate, and is probably
true; but it is a proposition equally incapable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
proof and of disproof."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> To the same effect are the
words of Sir John Herschel,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and still more recently of
Professor Jevons.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>"Nature," says Dr. Cohn, of Breslau, "is an equation
with very many unknown quantities. It is the work of natural
science to determine the value of these quantities.
Some believe it never will be possible to solve the equation,
since in it factors occur which can not be determined."
Until this is done, it is simply presumptuous for Dr. Tyndall
to pretend to know all the antecedents which determine
the complex phenomena of nature, and dogmatically
to affirm that "no new agency is created," and no "interference
of Divine agency" can be permitted. "Our knowledge
of things is finite, while our ignorance is infinite; and
we must consequently regard all known lines of causation
as being liable to be cut through by unknown ones." For
aught we know to the contrary one of the unknown factors
in the equation may be "personal volition," may be the
ceaseless energy of the Divine Will sustaining and carrying
nature forward through successive stages toward a predestinated
goal. The foremost physicists do not deny that
there may possibly be forms of energy which are neither
potential nor kinetic.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> We venture to assert with Prof.
Challis that will, or personal energy, is neither the one
nor the other, but the source of both. Mind is the originator,
and matter is the recipient of force.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>We sum up what has been said in the preceding paragraphs
on the uniformity of nature in the following words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
We admit that the uniformity of the <i>constitution</i> of nature
is a self-evident and necessary truth. We admit also
that, so far as our experience extends, the uniformity of
the <i>course</i> of nature must be admitted as a scientific truth,
for to deny this would be to deny the possibility of all
science, inasmuch as all science is <i>prevision</i>. But at the
same time we maintain that the conclusions of scientific
inference must always be of a hypothetical and purely
provisional character, because it is impossible for us to
judge with absolute certainty how far our experience gives
us adequate information of the universe as a whole, and
of all the forces and phenomena which can have place
therein.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> The conservation of energy, for example, is a
very probable hypothesis which accords satisfactorily with
the experiments of scientific men during a few years past,
but it would be a gross misconception of the nature of
scientific inference to suppose that it is certain in the same
sense that a proposition in geometry is certain, or that any
fact of immediate consciousness is certain.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>Admitting the principle of the uniformity of nature as
a hypothetical inference from a limited experience, we advance
to the main position of Dr. Tyndall, namely, <i>that
personal volition can not mingle in or interfere with the
procession of phenomena in nature</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Tyndall admits the reality of "personal volition."
We have not discovered in his writings any indications of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the tendency manifested by some of his scientific associates
to reduce volition to a form of physical energy.
He grants "the power of free-will in man,"<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> but he seems
unwilling to admit that free-will can exert any controlling,
modifying, or determining influence on the procession
of phenomena. "Assuming the efficacy of prayer to produce
changes in external nature, it necessarily follows that
natural laws are more or less at the mercy of man's volition,
and no conclusion founded on the assumed permanence
of those laws would be worthy of confidence."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
But are not natural laws more or less subject to man's volition?
Does he not act <i>upon</i> the chain of cause and
effect in nature, and <i>alter</i> the procession of phenomena on
earth? Certainly he can and does control and direct the
forces of nature. He can so collocate and adjust the
properties and forces of matter as to accomplish the purposes
of his intelligence, and bring about <i>new</i> results
which would not otherwise have been produced. That
man has materially modified the physical geography of
the globe can not be denied. He has altered the climatal
condition of whole tracts of country, and changed the
physiognomy of the globe. The rain-fall has been changed
by the felling of timber or the planting of trees.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> He has
extended or circumscribed the geographical boundaries of
plants and animals. He has learned to control the mechanical,
chemical, and electric forces. When he lifts a
stone from the earth and suspends it in the air, or locks
it in the arch that spans the river, the law of gravitation
is subordinated to the higher law of intelligent purpose.
By the collocation and adjustment of mechanical forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
he overcomes the resistance of winds and tides, and guides
his vessel across the trackless deep. He seizes the lightning
in the clouds and guides it harmless to the earth,
and sends the electric current along the telegraphic wire
to chronicle his deeds and report his thoughts at the ends
of the earth. He loosens the most intricate combinations
of elementary substances, and recomposes them in new
forms of the highest value in medicine and the fine arts.
He solidifies carbonic acid; freezes water at the tropics,
and even in red-hot crucibles in the Temperate Zone. He
also modifies and changes the development of vegetable
life, obliterating thorns and spines, altering the color and
size of flowers, and the flavor and nutritive character of
fruits. And, finally, he has wrought marvelous changes
in the form, size, habits, and instincts of the animal creation.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
Thus in numberless ways does man control, modify,
and subordinate nature to accomplish the purposes of his
intelligence; but we can not see with Dr. Tyndall how
this renders scientific "conclusions founded on the assumed
permanence of natural law unworthy of confidence."</p>

<p>There is a vacillation in Dr. Tyndall's treatment of this
aspect of the subject which renders it difficult to fix his
exact position. Does he intend to assert that "personal
volition" can not in the slightest degree change the succession
of phenomena? Will he say that man does not,
and that God can not control and modify and subordinate
natural forces so as to bring about <i>new</i> and <i>special</i> results?
Unless he is prepared to assert this in the most unequivocal
manner, the whole superstructure of his argument falls
to the ground. If it is granted that human volition can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
change the procession of phenomena, and "alter within
certain limits the current of events," then <i>à fortiori</i> we
may conclude that Divine volition may also interfere in
the economy of nature to answer prayer. At one time
Dr. Tyndall insinuates that "our notion" (that is, the Christian's
conception) "of the Power which rules the universe"
is a "mere fanciful or ignorant enlargement of human
power,... a <i>mythologic imagination</i> which pictures a
being able and willing to do any and every conceivable
thing."<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> At another time he admits that "the theory that
the system of nature is under the control of a Being
who changes phenomena in compliance with the prayers
of men is, in my opinion, a perfectly legitimate one....
It is a matter of experience that an earthly father, who is
at the same time both wise and tender, listens to the requests
of his children, and if they do not ask amiss, takes
pleasure in granting their requests. We know also that
this compliance extends to the alteration, within certain
limits, of the current of events on earth. With this suggestion
offered by our experience, it is no departure from
scientific method to place behind natural phenomena a
universal Father, who in answer to the prayers of his
children alters the currents of phenomena. Thus far
theology and science go hand in hand. The conception
of an ether, for example, trembling with the waves of
light, is suggested by the ordinary phenomena of wave-motion
in water and in air; and in like manner the conception
of personal volition in nature is suggested by the
ordinary action of man upon earth. I therefore urge no
<i>impossibilities</i>, though you constantly charge me with doing
so. I do not even urge inconsistency, but, on the contrary,
frankly admit that you have as good a right to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
your conception at the root of phenomena as I have to
place mine."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>If this concession is made in good faith, and really
means any thing at all, it covers the whole ground. It is
neither unscientific nor irrational to place behind natural
phenomena a universal Father who alters the current of
phenomena in answer to prayer. But this is not the conception
which Dr. Tyndall places behind the phenomena
of nature. His conception is that of a <i>permanent force</i>,
which is "under the circumstances <i>necessary</i>," producing
"an unerring order which in our experience knows no exception."
This brings us to the third and last question.</p>

<p>3. How can the scientific conception of the <i>force</i> which
is manifested in the phenomena of nature be brought
into harmony with the idea of <i>God</i> as revealed in the
religious consciousness?</p>

<p>We are now in the very heart of what we have characterized
as the debatable ground which lies between science
and religion, where questions are mooted concerning the
relation between God and nature.</p>

<p>On the one side we have the facts of external sensible
experience&mdash;the <i>statical</i> phenomena of nature as mass,
extension, position, and distance&mdash;conditions essential to
the action or manifestation of force; then the <i>dynamical</i>
phenomena of nature as rotatory, vibratory, pulsatory, gyratory,
and transitive motion, which to our reason, not to our
senses, are manifestations of force. Science observes the
uniformity of relations among these phenomena&mdash;uniformities
of resemblance, co-existence, and succession, and
calls these uniformities <i>laws of nature</i>. This is all that
science can do, all that men of exact science claim to be
able to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other side we have the facts of internal experience&mdash;the
consciousness of effort, the sense of power and
freedom, the idea of right and wrong, the feeling of dependence,
of duty, and of obligation, the consciousness of
moral responsibility and of moral desert, and the anticipation
of a future retribution. These to our reason are the
revelation of a righteous Lawgiver and Ruler who is over
us; by whom we are obliged, and to whom we must account.
This is the theoretic basis and necessary presupposition
of all religion.</p>

<p>And now speculative philosophy steps in and endeavors
to reduce these concepts of science and religion to an ultimate
unity. It endeavors to construe in thought the
nature of that relation between the force manifested in
nature and the moral Ruler revealed in conscience. Therefore
it asks the questions, What is force? What is life?
What is mind?</p>

<p>If we say that force is as inherent and essential to matter
as extension and inertia are, and that life and mind are
but modes of force, we are on the high-road to mechanical
Deism, if not <i>material Atheism</i>. If we say that matter
is itself only a function of force, and that force is the ultimate
of all ultimates, then the distinction between finite
existence and the infinite Being is a merely verbal distinction,
and we must yield to the seductions of <i>Pantheism</i>,
which under this aspect of it is but another name for
Atheism. But if we say that Spirit is the originator and
matter the recipient of force, or "the recipient of impulse
and energy," and that the immanent God is the life of all
nature, we are pure <i>Theists</i>. We have now a "workable
theory" by which we can satisfactorily interpret the universe.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the conception of Dr. Tyndall. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
power which he sees in nature is a force which is inherent
and essential to matter, and "in that matter he sees the
promise and the potency of all <i>terrestrial</i> life," but not of
all life, for "religion is life." The Power which is revealed
as the object of the "religious emotions" is a Power
which works for "righteousness," and is "intelligent" as well
as "ethical." This Power he seems to regard as distinct
from the force which produces the necessary phenomena
of nature. But whence does he obtain this conception of
force? He writes as though he had seen force, or cognized
force, by some one of the senses. We claim that
force is "a subtile mental conception, and not a sensuous
perception or phenomenon;"<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> it is a metaphysical idea, "a
postulate of reason applied to nature." We venture the
assertion that the physicist has not the remotest conception
of force except as a datum of consciousness. The senses
give us only phenomena. All we perceive is motion,
change, succession. "All we know or see is the effect;
we do not see force."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> So say all physicists as well as
all metaphysicians. "Experiences of force are not derived
from any thing else,... and the force by which
we ourselves produce changes, and which serves to symbolize
the cause of changes in general, is the final disclosure
of all analysis."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Whenever, therefore, Dr. Tyndall
attempts to account for motion and change in external
nature by assuming the existence of invisible, imponderable
forces, he is interpreting nature in terms of
consciousness&mdash;we mean that consciousness of personal causation
which we have when we put forth <i>effort</i> with an <i>intention</i>
thereby to accomplish an end. Force is known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
us by immediate consciousness as a function of our own
mind&mdash;that is, mind acting in will is conscious of itself as
a force. We are able to conceive of force in no other way.
"Force dissociated from personality and will must be forever
incomprehensible by us, because it would be something
contradictory to our consciousness."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> If we may
not regard will-force as "the type of all the force in nature,"
then the physicist knows nothing about it, does not
know there is any force, and the only consistent course is
to unite with Comte in eradicating the word from the
vocabulary of science.</p>

<p>In the only case in which we are admitted into any immediate
personal knowledge of the origin of force, we find
it connected with volition, with will, with motion, with intellect,
and with all the attributes of mind in which personality
consists.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> We must, therefore, conclude that all
force is mind-force, is spirit-force, and that the forces which
animate nature are spiritual. Either the force manifested
in the universe is the force of a self-existent and self-determining
Intelligent Will, or we can form no conception
of it whatever.</p>

<p>When we have once arrived at the conception of force
as an expression of will, which we derive from our experience
of its production, "the universal and constantly
sustaining agency of the Deity is recognized in every
phenomenon of the universe."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> "The laws of nature
are the laws which God in his wisdom prescribes to his
own acts. His universal presence is the necessary condition
of any course of events. His universal agency
the only origin of all efficient force."<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> The persistence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
of force is the permanence of the Divine agency, and
the deepest ground of our faith in the uniformity and
changelessness of natural laws is the immutability of
God.</p>

<p>We come, then, at last, to this, that the Power which is
manifested in nature is the God who is revealed in consciousness,
and that He is at once a God of power, of
righteousness, and of love. In prayer, the intelligent
believer does not invoke a different Power from that
which is manifested in all the forms of physical energy
which were manifested in nature; he does but invoke
the <i>same</i> Power and the <i>only</i> Power which is the source
of all causation and produces all the processions of phenomena.</p>

<p>The perpetual immanence and ceaseless action of God
in nature is the source of all <i>force</i> and all <i>law</i>. There
is no force and no law besides and apart from this. All
our conceptions of necessity and uniformity, of special providence
and miracle, are merely relative conceptions which
result from our imperfect vision. These are all swallowed
up and lost in the Divine Immensity. God is Power.
God is Law. God is Love. Love is the motive, Law is
the method, and Power is the hand manifested in all the
changes of the universe. "The devout feel that wherever
God's hand is, <i>there</i> is miracle; and it is simply an
undevoutness which imagines that only where miracle is
can there be the hand of God."</p>

<p>Let us say with Goethe, "Nature is the living garment
of God," which at once reveals and conceals his mysterious
splendors. In our days of darkness and sorrow and
danger there are vouchsafed to us clearer gleamings of the
Creative Spirit through the veil of nature in answer to
prayer. These we may call "special providences," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
even "miracles," if we please, but let us not fall into the
error of supposing that we have seen more of God than
in the budding of the leaf or the blooming of the flower
in the time of spring. "There are diversities of operations,
but it is the <i>same</i> God which worketh all in all."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>From the fundamental truth that God is the Creator and
Conservator of the universe, and that his providence presides
over and directs the historic development of humanity,
Christian doctrine advances, in a natural and logical
order, to the recognition of the more direct and personal
relations between God and each individual human soul.
"He is not far from <i>any one</i> of us, for in Him we live
and move and are." God is intimately near to the human
soul. God is the immanent ground of men's spiritual
being. God is the Father of the human spirit. Therefore
God is manifested <i>in</i> man&mdash;in the constitution of his
moral nature, and in the susceptibilities, the aspirations,
the longings, the hopes and fears of his spiritual being;
and God manifests Himself <i>to</i> man by an inward illumination&mdash;"the
true <i>light</i> which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world." Contemplate these relations on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the Divine side, and you have the foundation of all moral
government; study them on the human side, and you have
the foundation of all religion, for religion is a mode of
thought, of feeling, and of action determined by the consciousness
of our relations to God.</p>

<p>All Christian teaching proceeds upon the assumption
that there exist in all men the elements of a <i>religious
consciousness</i>. The recognition of some relation to an unseen
moral Personality is a universal fact of human nature.
The feeling of dependence, the sense of obligation,
the sentiment of reverence, the tendency to worship, the
apprehension of a future reward or punishment&mdash;these are
the common characteristics of man. The untutored savage,
the half-civilized pagan, the ancient philosopher, the
modern scientist, all alike betray the consciousness of some
mysterious bond which holds them fast to the unseen Power
which controls the destinies of men. With this sentiment
of the Divine there is associated in all human minds
an instinctive yearning after the Invisible, a conscious susceptibility
of our spiritual nature to the influences of the
higher world, and a reaching out of the human spirit toward
the Infinite, which prompt man to seek for a fuller
knowledge and a deeper communion. Christianity assures
us that this religious consciousness may, by a loving reception
of the truth and a loyal allegiance to duty, be raised
into a living <i>koinonia</i>&mdash;a living fellowship with and a
conscious participation of the Divine life. Man may
know God, not simply by verbal instruction, not merely
through the symbolism of nature, or the providential unfoldings
of human history, or even the moral attributes of
his own spiritual being, but by an exalted and immediate
consciousness. "The pure in heart shall <i>see</i> God" by an
inward vision of wondrous power and glory, in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
shall know God, and be as fully assured of his personal
love and guidance as of the love and guidance of any
human friend.</p>

<p>Now there is a natural order in which the knowledge
of God is clearly differentiated and fully developed in the
human mind; and this order is distinctly recognized and
noted in the words of St. Paul&mdash;"That they may <i>seek</i> God,
and truly <i>feel</i> God, and actually <i>find</i> God."</p>

<p>1. There is an earnest <i>inquiry</i> (ζητεῖν)&mdash;a search after
God. This is the effort of reflective thought to attain a
more exact and definite conception of that Power and Intelligence
which the spontaneous consciousness of man
immediately and instinctively affirms as the ground and
cause and law of the created universe.</p>

<p>2. There is a real <i>feeling</i> (ψηλαφᾶν) of God&mdash;an awakening
consciousness of some near relation to God, excited
by the voice of conscience and the spiritual affinities
and yearnings of the soul. There is, as it were, a "<i>touching</i>"
of the living God<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>&mdash;the sense of a living bond which
holds man to God, not merely by a consciousness of dependence
and obligation, but a spiritual nexus, a real filiation,
which enables man to articulate the wondrous words,
"<i>We are the offspring of God</i>."</p>

<p>3. There is an actual <i>finding</i> (εὑρίσκειν) of God&mdash;that
higher religious consciousness in which the pure and earnest
soul attains a personal knowledge, and enters into a
beatifying communion with "the Father of the human
spirit." This direct "manifestation of God" in its highest
form is the peculiar glory of that new and divine
life of the soul communicated through Christian faith, for
which all antecedent knowledges and experiences, whether
of the individual mind or of collective humanity, are a
preparation and a discipline.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>
<p>This inspired statement of the order in which the conception
of God as a determinate mode of thought is
evolved in the human mind is exactly verified by the history
of reflective thought as presented in Greek philosophy.
Reflective thought began with Thales in Asia Minor
and Pythagoras in Lower Italy. The Ionian and Italian
schools commenced most naturally with the objective
phenomena of nature, and sought for the ἀρχή&mdash;the first
principle and cause of all that appears. Their question
was not, <i>Is</i> there a first principle and cause? but <i>What</i> is
the first principle and cause? The orderly phenomena of
the universe presented themselves to their minds as the
expression of <i>power</i> and <i>thought</i> as certainly as they do
to ours; and their endeavor was to construe this intuition
in logical form and give it articulate expression. It is
true their method was at first defective, and the results attained
were consequently often erroneous. Still their mental
effort must have been unconsciously governed by those
fixed laws of cognition which constrain all minds to regard
all phenomena as the expression of power, and all orderly
arrangement as the utterance of thought. If in the realm
of objective things they fixed upon a single element as
that out of which all things else were evolved, that first
seed of things was either a living, potential energy, or it
was associated with and animated by a living soul.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Or if
guided by analogy, they conceived the universe as a living
organism,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whose body nature is, and God the soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The informing principle was still an <i>intelligent</i> Power.
So that at the end of this period of inquiry we find that
Anaxagoras distinctly articulates the word which his coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>trymen
had half unconsciously recognized, "the ἀρχή, or
first principle, is mind, intellect, νοῦς."</p>

<p>From this point we date a new era in philosophy. The
Socratic school turned from the contemplation of external
nature, and commenced the study of mind. Man finds
his rational nature in changeless correlation to a moral
law. There are within his spiritual nature the ideas of
justice, of truth, of purity, and of goodness. These ideas
of the human reason reflect the character of its Author
and Source, and we can not refrain from ascribing these
attributes in their most perfect form to the Maker of the
human soul. God is now regarded as the Moral Ruler
of the world. Man becomes conscious of obligation to a
personal Lawgiver, and of accountability to a personal
Judge. He feels that he has spiritual susceptibilities and
longings for a Divine inspiration. He believes that man
"may become conscious of the wisdom and the love of
the Deity," and that there are "Divine secrets which may
not be penetrated by man, but which are imparted to
those who consult, who adore, and who obey God."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
Yielding to these spiritual affinities of the soul, he seeks
God in prayer.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> He desires to come near to God, to feel
his presence and inspiration, and to become "assimilated
to God," by "becoming holy, just, and wise."<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Whether any of the ancient philosophers attained to
that high religions consciousness in which God is actually
"found," so that He becomes the object of a real love and
confidence, and a refuge amid the storms and adversities
of life, is a question we may not be competent to answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>To attempt an answer may be deemed presumptuous. If
the Divine declaration that "<i>every one</i> that asketh receiveth,
and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that
knocketh it shall be opened," is of universal application,
then it may, at least, be hoped that the prayer of Socrates
was answered, and the desire of Plato was fulfilled, and
the aspiration of Epictetus was satisfied in some degree.
Socrates certainly expressed the belief that "he was moved
by a certain Divine and spiritual impulse."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Plato held
that the highest form of philosophy is the love of the Supreme
Good&mdash;that is, God; and that "a man who is just
and pious and entirely good is loved of God."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> And
Epictetus taught that "if we always remember that in all
we do God stands by as a witness, we shall not err in our
prayers and actions, and <i>we shall have God dwelling with
us</i>." Do not these utterances remind us vividly of the
Saviour's promise&mdash;"If <i>a man</i> love me, he will keep my
words, and my Father will love him, and we will come
unto him, and make our abode with him?" Can we doubt
that these words express the Divine feeling and the Divine
procedure toward the heathen world? Was not God their
Father as well as ours? Was not Christ their Saviour as
well as our Saviour? May we not hope that the redeeming
Word enlightened their minds, and the sanctifying
Spirit touched their hearts?</p>

<p>It will be obvious to the thoughtful reader that this order,
in which the definite knowledge of God is attained, is
the reverse of that in which the idea of God is manifested
in the spontaneous consciousness of the individual and the
race. The former is analytical, the latter is synthetical.
The <i>idea</i> of God as the ground and cause and reason of
all existence is immediately given in spontaneous thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>conception</i> of God as pure Spirit, as the eternal Reason,
the righteous Will, the supreme Good, the omnipresent
Ruler of the universe, and the Father of humanity,
is gradually developed in reflective thought. The first is
a metaphysical <i>datum</i>, standing at the commencement of
all inquiry, the second is a logical <i>quoesitum</i> which is
reached at the end of a process of rational inquiry. Spontaneous
consciousness begins with an indeterminate feeling,
a mysterious presentiment of the Divine; it proceeds
through simple intuition, and ends with affirmative thought.
Reflective consciousness begins by questioning our primitive
beliefs, and asking for their logical grounds; it proceeds
by analytic and inductive reasoning, and may result
in the union of logical convictions, with determinate affections&mdash;an
intelligent reverence and an appreciating
love. Spontaneous thought is involuntary, and must necessarily
result in faith. Reflective thought is voluntary,
and may result in error, doubt, and skepticism. Therefore
the method by which we attain to a clear and determinate
knowledge of God&mdash;by which we really <i>feel</i>, and
actually <i>find</i> God&mdash;may be defeated, interrupted, and
marred by sin. Unholy passion and a perverted will may
materially vitiate the process by which the human reason
reaches a logical conviction of the being of a God.
The ungodly man may desire that the First Cause shall
have no moral attributes. The sinner may imagine that
the Deity is "altogether such an one as himself." The
fool may say in his heart, "There is no God." While the
idea of God presents itself naturally and necessarily in
spontaneous thought, there may be an "unwillingness to
retain God in the knowledge." And even where God is
known, He may not be honored and gratefully recognized;
and, as a consequence, the "understanding may be darken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>ed."
Swallowed up of uncleanness and lust, the abandoned
man may "barter the truth of God for lies," and eventually
"worship and serve the creature <i>more</i> than the Creator."
Still man can not utterly relegate himself from all
sense of obligation, and all feeling of dependence upon
God. He can not sever the link which binds him to his
Maker. He can not wholly extinguish in his heart the
sense of the Divine, nor eradicate from his reason the
ideas which, in their spontaneous, unimpeded development,
reveal to him the personal Lawgiver and Judge. Where
there is any rectitude of purpose, any sincere love for
truth, there will be, in a proportionate measure, the true
knowledge of God. And the pure mind may assuredly
rise to that higher religious consciousness in which doubt
and uncertainty are swallowed up in an inward vision of
his glory.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have the rational foundation for moral
government, and the ultimate ground of all religion. The
possibility of knowing God, the obligation to reverence
and obey God, the power to do the will of God, the susceptibility
of the human heart for Divine inspiration and
Divine communing, are all grounded upon the <i>correlations
between God and man</i>. "God is not far from any
one of us, for in Him we live and move and are; as certain
of your own poets have said, '<i>For we are his offspring</i>."'</p>

<p>1. <i>The relation between God and man is a relation of
contiguity.</i> God is perpetually near to man. "He is
not far from any one of us." The sacred Scriptures not
only teach the ubiquity of God, but they emphasize the immediateness
of the Divine presence in relation to man.
"Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I
flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there.
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead
me, and thy right hand shall hold me. Thou hast beset
me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me."
No man can escape from God. We may retire to the remotest
parts of the earth, and take up our abode in the
most solitary isle; we may press our way into the deepest
recesses of the primeval forest, to spots where the foot of
man has never trod, and on which the light of heaven has
never shone, and where solitude has held its undisturbed
reign ever since the morning of creation, and the conviction
that "God is in this place" will relieve the loneliness,
and hold us fast within the grasp of his government
and laws. Let human thought take to itself the
wings of imagination and pierce the heavens, let it travel
on through the immensity of space until it has reached the
confines of the universe, let it alight on one of the outermost
stars which seem to stand as sentinels at the very
outposts of creation, and looking out upon the depths of
space, there shall be heard the voice of God toning on
throughout the fathomless abyss, "Can any hide himself
in secret places that I shall not see?" "Do not I fill heaven
and earth? saith the Lord." God is not far from any one
of us. He is the "<i>Ever Near</i>." Nearer to us than the air
we breathe, nearer than the light which reveals surrounding
objects, nearer than our body, the living vesture of the soul,
is God. In the words of the Persian oracle, "God is nearer
to thee than thou art unto thyself." As the Infinite Mind is
present to all rational beings, so are they all present to Him.
God is omniscient. The thoughts, feelings, and actions of
all men are immediately and directly known by Him. "O
Lord, thou hast searched me and known me. Thou know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>est
my downsitting and mine uprising, Thou understandest
my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my
lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For
there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, Thou
knowest it altogether." The first condition of a moral
government is found in the nearness, the contiguity of God
to every human soul, and the immediate and infallible
knowledge which He consequently must possess of every
human thought and act.</p>

<p>2. <i>The relation between God and man is a relation of
immanency.</i> "In Him we live and move and are" (ἐσμέν,
= have conscious being). Our life, our power, our consciousness
are <i>from</i> God, <i>through</i> God, and <i>in</i> God.
This relation is manifestly something more immediate
than the relation of contiguity. It is the present, instant,
ceaseless relation of Divine <i>efficiency</i>. This is involved
in the very idea of the creature. If man is the creature of
God, he has not only his beginning, but his continuance of
existence by a real and immediate causality. God alone
possesses true life&mdash;"life in Himself"&mdash;He alone is really
self-existent, our life and our being are continually derived
from Him. If we were without God, and entirely isolated
from Him, we could not live or move or even exist.
God is every where, not virtually but actually. He pervades
and interpenetrates all existences without displacing
them in space or disturbing their operations. His infinite
essence underlies all the principles and powers of all created
existences; they all move within the range of his
presence, and act within the sphere of his energy. And
God is not only present immediately to man, but his mighty
will sustains man in existence every moment, vitalizing his
organism, endowing him with power, illuminating his reason,
and inspiring him with knowledge. God is immanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
in man, and man is immanent in God. "To us there is but
one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we <i>in</i>
Him."<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>&mdash;"One God and Father of all, who is above all,
and <i>through</i> all, and <i>in</i> you all."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>&mdash;"The same God who
worketh <i>all</i> in <i>all</i>."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Our life is from God and in God.
Our power to energize is from God and constantly sustained
by God. We consciously know in and through
God, who so illuminates our reason that we can interpret
the symbolism of nature. "God teacheth man knowledge."
"He giveth wisdom to the wise and prudence to
men of understanding." "There is a spirit in man, and
the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him understanding."
The reason of man is a beam of the eternal reason.
"The spirit of a man is the candle of the Lord." All good
desires, all noble impulses, all power to resist temptation
and perform heroic acts of endurance and suffering, are
from God. "Every good and every perfect gift cometh
down from above, from the Father of Lights."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>The constant, ceaseless dependence of all rational existence
on God for vitality, for power, and for consciousness
must be maintained, if we would be faithful to the plain
language of Scripture. We are aware that fears of a pantheistic
perversion has led some men, without reason, to
refine upon the language of Scripture. By the expression
"<i>in</i> Him" (ἐν αυτῷ), we are, they say, to understand
"<i>with</i> Him." But ἐν αυτῷ does not mean "<i>with</i> Him" or
"<i>through</i> Him." The most natural grammatical construc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>tion
is "<i>in</i> Him," and this suits best the logical connection.
The Uncreated is the only self-existent being. All other
existences are derived and dependent, and therefore can
not be self-existent. The Supreme can not communicate
the attribute of self-existence any more than the attribute
of infinity. A finite existence can not be at once dependent
and independent. Of mind, as well as of matter, it is
equally true that the sole ground of its continuing to be,
as well as its beginning to be, is in the Almighty will and
power directly and ceaselessly put forth. The direct agency
of God sustaining conscious life is a universal, constant,
profound <i>reality</i>.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>It may be objected that in maintaining these views we
are in danger of sacrificing the personality of man. It
may be asked, How can we sustain the antithesis between
the I and Thou of a commandment or of a prayer? How
can we reconcile human self-determination with absolute
dependence upon God? How can we conceive the possibility
of sin&mdash;the possibility of a creature dependent every
moment on God for power, acting in opposition to the
mind and will of God?</p>

<p>These are questions of profound significance; they are
also questions of extreme difficulty. Our reason staggers
under their weight. We tremble in the presence
of the mystery of evil. It is obvious that these questions
involve the deeper question as to the causal connection
of God with his creation, which all men confess is an
insoluble and impenetrable mystery. The feeling of dependence
on the one hand, as well as the sense of personal
power and freedom on the other, are primitive facts
of consciousness. That we live and move and have our
being in God, and that we have a real determinate self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>hood,
a finite personality, a responsible spirit-life, are both
affirmed in Scripture. That a holy God made the world,
and still actually upholds it; and that sin, as lawlessness
(ἀνομία), as a real antagonism to the will and nature
of God, exists in his world, can not be denied by Christian
men. These are equally truths. To our conception,
they may appear antithetical, if not contradictory. But
truth is often of a dual character; like the magnet, it may
have opposite poles. And many of the differences which
agitate the world are often to be traced to the exclusiveness
with which different parties affirm one half of the duality
in forgetfulness of the other half. We must accept
both aspects of the truth, even though we can not at present
effect their real conciliation in thought, and wait for
further light.</p>

<p>A profound faith in the unity of all truth will inspire
the hope that reason may yet attain to ultimate principles
in which shall be found the harmony of facts and subordinate
principles that to-day seem irreconcilable. Underlying
the above apparently antithetical truths we
can even now dimly discern still more fundamental principles
which prophesy a solution. If Divine Love will
that there shall be other existences who shall resemble
God, and be capable of fellowship with Him in knowledge
and in love&mdash;in other words, shall be <i>perfect</i> so far as is
consistent with the notion of dependent existence&mdash;these
beings must have a real selfhood, a conscious personality,
a conditioned freedom. For impersonal being, even
though it may by its absolute dependence reveal the eternal
power, and in some degree reflect the thought of
God, can not in any sense be the <i>image</i> of God, who is absolute
Personality. Above all, that which can not know
itself, can not know God, and can not love God. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
which can not freely determine itself, can not obey God or
resemble God. The highest form of spirit-life "is the conscious
return, by a free identification, of every delegated
power into harmony with its source." Real being and
real life in God must therefore involve, not only a consciousness
of dependence and obligation, but also self-consciousness
and self-determination. Resemblance to God
and fellowship with God are possible only through these
fundamental elements of personality. Moral union requires
dynamical separation. And because God wills this
highest unity, He creates the highest individuality, and
gives being to a will under concessions of freedom.</p>

<p>We conceive of the Divine conservation of the world
and man as "the simple, universal, uniform efficiency of
God which sustains the created powers in every moment
of their activity, and thereby keeps them bound to Himself.
As such it makes itself the basis of all individual efficiencies
in the life and movement of the world, <i>without
indeed itself, as such, giving to the efficiency of creaturely
powers any particular direction</i>." The conserving
activity of God moves in prearranged lines, and according
to laws and measures determined by the infinite wisdom
of God, and conserves, therefore, all individual existence
only within the boundaries which are fixed by these arrangements,
and through the relations of the powers of the
world. Thus as the world-conserving activity of God leaves
all creatures just as it finds them, and equally embraces
irrational as well as rational beings, "the evil as well as the
good" (Matt. v. 45), it can in nowise remove the answerableness
of man for his sins, or in any way taking part in
the same. The world-conserving efficiency of God sustains
man every moment in being, and conditions the activity
of his moral powers even when they are exerted in an evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
choice, just as it sustains the universe according to a predetermined
plan and in harmony with fixed laws; but it
does not thereby give to the activity of the moral creature
any determinate direction whatever, either good or evil.
The general power to will and do is received immediately
and constantly from God, but it is a delegation of power
under concessions of freedom and conditions of accountability.
The specific determinations of that power are from
man himself. He may give an evil direction to his derived
and dependent activities, and thus commit sin. The
responsibility for that evil determination rests upon himself
alone, even though he is every moment pervaded and sustained
by the conserving efficiency of God. Alternative
power is a talent loaned out by God to man. But it is a
talent which still belongs to God, for the proper or improper
use of which man is accountable.</p>

<p>It has been urged by the captious critic, who would fain
cast upon God all responsibility for the presence of evil in
the world, that "if God does not actually determine the
evil, He delegates to man the power to actualize evil; let
Him only refuse his conserving efficiency to the will of
man, and thus prevent the evil!" The reckless objector
knoweth not what he saith. In order to render evil impossible,
it is demanded that God shall rob man of his personality,
and degrade him to the level of impersonal nature;
for the possibility of evil is inseparable from the notion
of free, self-determined existence. "The momentary
withdrawment of the conserving activity of God from the
moral creature were the immediate annihilation of its existence."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
Liberty is not only a good, but it is the necessary
condition of all goodness. It is the sphere of all great
virtues, noble deeds, and heroic acts. There can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
virtue, no praiseworthiness, no godlikeness, no real felicity,
where there is no freedom. Shall we reproach God for
having made us free personalities? Shall we complain
because God has honored us by committing to us a sacred
trust, and placed our happiness and well-being largely
under our own control? Who would surrender his conscious
power and freedom, and sacrifice the infinite possibilities
of good which lie before him, to escape the possibility
of failure and suffering and defeat? Will any rational
man exchange his position for that of the ant or the
beaver? "What," exclaims Rousseau, "to render man incapable
of evil, would we have him lowered to mere brute
instinct? No! God of my soul, I will not reproach Thee
for having made me in thine image, so that I might be
good and free and happy like Thyself."</p>

<p>The ceaseless dependence of man on the conserving efficiency
of God imposes upon him the obligation to determine
himself, and to regulate his action in conformity
with the will of God. Here, then, we have found a still
deeper ground for moral government.</p>

<p>3. <i>The relation of God to man is a relation of paternity;
the relation of man to God is a relation of childship.</i>
"We are his offspring;" and as the offspring of
God we must have a kindred nature, and, in some sense,
"resemble God."</p>

<p>God is "the Father of the human spirit" by no mere
figure of speech, but by a Divine reality; and man, in virtue
of that rational and spiritual nature inbreathed and,
as it were, begotten within him by the "Eternal Word of
God," is "the likeness and image of God." It is one of
the changeless laws of all derived and dependent existence
that the offspring shall resemble the parent. And just as
every seed must produce its own kind, just as every off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>spring
must be of the same species as its parent, so must
man bear the image of God.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> This image of God can
have no reference to the body of man, nor to any qualities
or attributes which belong to matter. Spirit is the only
thing which does bear or is capable of bearing any resemblance
to God. The all-pervading personality of God is
mirrored in the finite personality of man. The four grand
elements of personality are <i>intelligence</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>affection</i>, and
<i>conscience</i>, and these in man reflect the character of God.
Elevated to absolute perfection, they become the august attributes
of Omniscience, Omnipotence, All-lovingness, and
All-holiness. "One God," says Cousin, "is doubtless the
author of the world, and as his workmanship it must reflect,
in some measure, his perfections. But He is especially
the Father of humanity. His intelligence and his personality
are therefore of the same kind with our intelligence
and our personality, to which we add infinity by a
necessary law of thought." So that our knowledge, our
freedom, our charity, our justice, give us the idea of Divine
wisdom, Divine freedom, Divine justice, and Divine charity.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
These conclusions of philosophy are in striking harmony
with the positive statements of Scripture. Here we
are taught that the image of God in man consists in <i>power</i>,
<i>knowledge</i>, <i>righteousness</i>, and <i>benevolence</i> (ὁσιότης)<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>&mdash;ὅσιος,
from חֶסִיד = kind, merciful, benevolent.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, then, as man is the "offspring of God," he
may know <i>that</i> God is, and he may, in some measure at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
least, know <i>what</i> God is, and what are the duties which he
owes to God. Selfhood or personality in man is the primordial
germ of the idea of God. The self-consciousness,
the intelligence, the free activity, the potential righteousness
and charity of man must have their origin in a cause
which is itself a full and adequate explanation. We accept
the ancient philosophic maxim "<i>ex nihilo nihil</i>," and
apply it rigorously to the case in hand. "That which is
can not have arisen out of that which is not." "Out of
nothing nothing can arise." Consciousness can not arise
out of unconsciousness. Reason can not arise out of unreason.
Self-activity can not arise out of absolute passivity
and eternal rest. Justice, righteousness, charity, can not
be generated from brute matter, or born in the abyss of
nothingness. The Creator of man, of the reason that is in
man, of the moral liberty of man, of the ideas of justice
and benevolence which dwell in the conscience of man,
must Himself be intelligent, free, just, and good. Such is
the logic of Scripture and of common-sense. "He that
planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the
eye, shall He not see? He that chastiseth the heathen, shall
not He correct? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall
not He know?" He that made man a sentient, percipient,
self-conscious personality, shall not He be percipient and
self-conscious? He that hath given man reason, is He not
the Eternal Reason? He that hath planted in the hearts
of men the principles of justice, must not He be a righteous
Being? He that inspires man with compassion, must
not his nature be Love? "If the First Cause be destitute
of these qualities, then for us, at least, He is as though
He were not." He is a thousand times inferior to us&mdash;inferior
even in his infinity and his eternity to one hour of
our finite existence, if during that fugitive hour we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
<i>know</i> and <i>think</i> and <i>love</i>. A finite moral personality,
even though it be the most perfect form of <i>dependent</i> existence,
points, with an infallible logic, to a being beyond
and above itself, and suggests an Infinite Personality who is
absolute perfection&mdash;that is, a Being of perfect knowledge,
perfect freedom, perfect righteousness, and perfect love.</p>

<p>This community of nature between man and God is not
only the ground and condition of our knowing God, but it
is also the living, everlasting bond which holds man to
God, even in his sins. It involves much more than obligation&mdash;obligation
to an omnipotent Master, and submission
to an omnipresent Lord. Such sense of obligation
may be developed within the sphere of instinctive and unreasoning
life. But the kinship of souls to God brings
man within the sphere of <i>moral</i> life, with its eternal and
immutable laws. It endows man with the power and imposes
upon him the duty to reverence, adore, and love the
heavenly Father. Wonderful and awful, this idea of the
paternity of God and the childship of human souls! This
paternity of God is suggestive at once of the highest form
of authority and the most sacred form of duty that can be
conceived by the human mind. "The power of a sovereign,
however extensive it may be, is, after all, only conventional;
it admits of being circumscribed or suspended....
All earthly forms of authority, which belong to the
political, civil, or social relation of men, are accidental and
official, created by men for their own purposes, and may
be modified or abolished by the power that created them.
But the authority of a father over his child is founded in
nature and established by God. This is not a voluntary
arrangement among men themselves, which they are at
liberty to continue or to terminate as they please; but, on
the contrary, it is a Divine constitution. Such authority as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
a father possesses over his child&mdash;so natural, so real, so Divine&mdash;no
human being besides can possess over another.
This, accordingly, is the selected type of the supreme
rights of God, and of the essential sovereignty which belongs
to the Father of minds. No other explains, as this
does, the <i>foundation</i> and <i>nature</i> of Divine authority.
There are, indeed, other terms which indicate the mere
fact of sovereignty in God, and do so more pointedly and
directly than this. For example: He is compared to a
<i>king</i>&mdash;a name which belongs to the highest secular office
and the highest secular authority on earth. 'The Lord is
king forever.' His creatures are his subjects; He gives
them wise and righteous laws, and they must answer to
Him for obedience and disobedience. The comparison is
obviously just up to a certain limit; but it is obvious that
in many essential respects it entirely fails. The king and
his people are connected together only by one bond&mdash;that
of authority and corresponding subjection." The relation
is purely a contingent relation, and may be maintained by
arbitrary power. But the relation between God and his
rational creatures is a natural and a necessary relation.
All that is denoted by the word <i>king</i>&mdash;authority, power,
law&mdash;is really contained in the word <i>father</i>; but there
is much more conveyed in the word <i>father</i> than can be
possibly expressed by the word <i>king</i>. God is a king,
but He is a Father-king; his subjects are his own children,
and his government of them&mdash;in its origin, its spirit,
its laws, and even its penalties&mdash;is strictly paternal.
God's kingship is a <i>figure</i>, his fatherhood is the profoundest
<i>reality</i>.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>This correlation between the spirit of man and the
spirit of God is the living indissoluble bond which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
ever held, and shall forever hold the hearts of men to the
living God. Humanity has not been enchained to the
throne of God by servile fear, and held in subjection to
his government by the dread of future punishment. Fear
never made men virtuous, never can insure virtue. Man
has been held to God by spiritual affinities and a conscious
kinship. Men have always felt that the Ruler of
the world is merciful and just, and that his claim upon
their allegiance and loyal obedience is reasonable and
right. Therefore they have in all ages hoped in his
mercy, and confided in the righteousness of his administration.
This has been the consolation of the wise and
good in seasons of danger and adversity. To this Being
innocence and weakness under oppression and wrong
have made their proud appeal, like that of Prometheus
to the elements, to the witnessing world, to coming ages,
to the just ear of Heaven. When, therefore, Paul at
Athens announced that "God is not far from any one
of us, for in Him we live and move and are," he touched
a chord which vibrated in every heart. For in every
age men have had a presentiment of some nearer relation
to God than the rest of creation&mdash;a relation not
of dependence only, but of kinship and sonship. In moments
of deep feeling the poets, who are the best interpreters
of nature, have given oracular utterance to the
native feeling of the human heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We are all thine offspring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The image and the echo of thy eternal voice."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cleanthes.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All need his aid, his power sustains us all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we his offspring are."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Aratus.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Finally, as the spiritual nature of man is derived from
and correlated to God, he may become inwardly conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
of the Divine favor, or may be sensible of the Divine displeasure.
These are the sanctions of the moral law&mdash;the
reward and the penalty awarded to men. The smile of
God is heaven, the frown of God is hell. Here we have
found the deepest ground of a Divine government&mdash;the
paternity of God.</p>

MORAL GOVERNMENT.<br/>

<p>"The times of this ignorance God overlooked, but now commandeth all
men every where to repent; because He hath appointed a day in the which

<p>The relations existing between God and man, especially
the correlations of paternity and filiation, constitute the
ultimate foundations of Moral Government. This is the
conclusion of the preceding discussion. If God is intimately
near to man&mdash;if He is immanent in man, and man
is immanent in God&mdash;if God is "the Father of the human
spirit," and man "the offspring of God," then man
must bear some resemblance to God&mdash;he must have a spiritual
and immortal nature, must be a free personality,
must be capable of knowing and loving God, and therefore
must be under solemn responsibility to God, and
within the sphere of the eternal and immutable laws of
moral life; in a word, he must be the subject of <i>moral</i>
government.</p>

<p>We proceed now to consider, more especially, the <i>nature</i>,
the <i>conditions</i>, the <i>methods</i>, and the <i>ends</i> of moral
government.</p>

<p>I. <i>The nature of moral government.</i>&mdash;Government, in
general, is control&mdash;control with a view to the maintenance
of order. This may be effected by direct coaction or
forceful compulsion; or by the reaction of natural conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>quences;
or by the pervasive influence of moral motives.
The first is constraint, the second is restraint, the third is
authoritative direction. We must, therefore, distinguish
between physical, natural, and moral government.</p>

<p>The <i>physical</i> government of God is the absolute control
which He exercises over the material creation. He is the
Fountain-head of all the forces, and the Author of all the
laws according to which passive, unconscious matter is resistlessly
impelled; and because his power and wisdom
are infinite, and his purposes are immutable, therefore
material nature is uniform, and there is an all-pervading
order in the physical world.</p>

<p>The <i>natural</i> government of God is that constitution of
nature, and of man in so far as he is a part of nature, by
which the sensations of pleasure and pain result directly
and necessarily from the actions of man; and inasmuch
as he is able by an induction from experience to foresee
these consequences, and to determine his own conduct in
view of them, they are not improperly called rewards and
punishments. Thus it is found by experience that disease
and suffering result from acts of intemperance and licentiousness,
and men are restrained from the commission of
these acts by the fear of their foreseen results. This is
control by the reaction of natural consequences in that intermediate
sphere which we may designate the physico-moral
order of the world.</p>

<p>The <i>moral</i> government of God is that kind of control
which a wise and virtuous parent exercises over his family,
or a just and equitable magistrate over his subjects.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
It is a government by laws or rules addressed to the reason,
by moral motives which appeal to the conscience, and
by moral sanctions which appeal to the emotions. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
constitution in which God has declared his will to man,
and taught him, prior to the experience of retributive consequences,
what is right and what is wrong; a constitution
under which man is endowed with the capacity of perceiving
the inherent righteousness of the Divine law, of feeling
the imperative claims of duty, and of apprehending a
future retribution, and also a real causative power of self-determination
and choice. Finally, it is an economy in
which ample scope is afforded for the development of responsible
character. It is a probation in which there are
tests and temptations, in which forbearance is exercised
and consequences are delayed, in which remedial agencies
are plied and opportunities are afforded for repentance
and reformation, and in the final consummation of which
virtuous character shall receive its meet reward, and sinful
character its merited punishment. This is the ideal
order of moral life.</p>

<p>This twofold distinction between the <i>physical</i> and the
<i>spiritual</i>, and between the <i>natural</i> and the <i>moral</i>, runs
through the entire domain of existence and action, of being
and becoming.</p>

<p>The terms <i>physical</i> and <i>spiritual</i> are employed as collective
terms to connote the essential, changeless, and permanent
attributes of certain entities or realities which are
regarded as ultimate, viz., matter and spirit. The attributes
of matter are extension, divisibility, absolute incompressibility,
and inertia; the attributes of spirit are sensitivity,
reason, power, spontaneity, and memory. The term
physical is further employed to denote certain "affections
of matter"&mdash;that is, mechanical effects which are the
result of the action of force upon matter. It is true we
often speak of "physical forces," as though force were an
essential attribute of matter. But this is one of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
ambiguities of language. All that we mean by physical
force is a force which acts upon matter, and produces in
the motions and collocations of matter its appropriate effects.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
Spirit-force is the only force in the universe; all
that our physical science deals with is "forms of energy
which have their origin in force." "Mind," says Dr.
Carpenter, "is the one and only source of power."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>The terms <i>natural</i> and <i>moral</i> are employed to denote
opposite modes of action and classes of effects. In the
one case the mode of action is fixed and uniform, and the
effect is necessary; in the other case the mode of action is
free and volitional, and the effect is contingent and variable.
The first is the order of nature where force reigns,
the second is the order of moral life where freedom prevails.
"Whatever is comprised in the chain and mechanism
of cause and effect, of course necessitated, and having
its necessity in some other thing antecedent or concurrent,
this is said to be <i>natural</i>, and the aggregate and system
of all such things is nature."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> While, on the contrary,
that which lies within the agent's power, and to which he
determines himself by an act of free choice; and especially
that which the agent knows he <i>ought</i> to do, and in
choosing which he is conscious of power to put forth, in
the same unchanged circumstances, a different volition instead,
is called <i>moral</i>.</p>

<p>Thus does morality commence with "the sacred distinction"
between <i>thing</i> and <i>person</i>. "On this distinction
all legislation, human and Divine, proceeds." That which
fundamentally distinguishes a person from a mere thing
of nature is <i>free causality</i>&mdash;that is, "the power or immu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>nity
to put forth in the same circumstances either of several
volitions." A thing is unconscious, involuntary, and
powerless, and consequently limited to one sole possible
eventuation. A thing has no responsibility for its movements,
which it has not willed, and of the nature and consequences
of which it is ignorant. A person alone is responsible,
because he is intelligent and free; that is, he
can foresee the consequences of his action, and freely determines
himself to its performance. A thing has no dignity;
dignity attaches only to personality. Personality is
inalienable, sacred, and inviolable; it can not be abrogated,
surrendered, or transferred, and it demands to be
respected. In a word, it has both duties and rights, while
things have neither.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Thus do we find that all dignity, all sacredness, all responsibility,
all morality belong to and are predicable only
of the personal being, because intelligence and freedom are
the essential moments of personality.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the sphere of the <i>moral</i> is to be determined
by another important limitation. Not all the actions
of men are personal and responsible acts. Sensation is not
a voluntary operation. When the external object is brought
into proper relation with the animated organism, perception
necessarily occurs. The intuitive apperceptions of the
reason are impersonal; when a change transpires, the reason
necessarily affirms the existence of a cause. Reflex
nervous action is involuntary. Many muscular movements
are spontaneous, but not volitional. A responsible action
is an <i>intentional</i> action&mdash;that is, an act performed to realize
an end which lies within the agent's contemplation.
Spontaneity or self-determination only thereby becomes
<i>will</i>. A moral act is consequently a premeditated, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>tentional,
voluntary act, and the merit or demerit of an
agent is as his actual intention.</p>

<p>The last and most important limitation of the moral
sphere is to those voluntary actions which have relation
to personality, human and Divine. "The peculiar distinction
of moral actions, moral character, moral principles,
moral habits, as contrasted with the intellectual and
other parts of man's nature, lies in this, that they always
imply a relation between two persons."<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> Morality is the
relation of person to person.</p>

<p>We sum up what has been said in the preceding paragraphs
in these words: The moral government of God is
a <i>legislation</i> which has respect to personality, especially
the relations of person to person; and it is an <i>administration</i>
under which the subjects have power to resist and
violate its requirements, but which is provided with ample
means to vindicate its authority, and maintain the moral
order of the universe.</p>

<p>II. <i>The subjective conditions of moral government.</i>&mdash;It
will be apparent from what has been already said that
the following conditions are essential to moral government:</p>

<p>(1.) The subject of moral government must be <i>intelligent</i>.
He must be able to understand the Divine requirements,
to perceive their inherent rightness, and to feel the sense
of obligation to comply therewith. He must also be susceptible
of certain pleasurable or painful <i>emotions</i> which
follow as the direct consequences of his actions, and secure
an adequate retribution. In a word, he must have a
moral consciousness, or, briefly, a <i>conscience</i>.</p>

<p>(2.) The subject of moral government must be a <i>free
power</i>. He must be the efficient cause of his own action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
and he must be conscious of this power of self-determination&mdash;that
is, he must be conscious of power to put forth,
in the same unchanged circumstances, either of several volitions.
In short, he must have a <i>free will</i>.</p>

<p>These, then, are the essential conditions of moral agency&mdash;the
possession of a <i>conscience</i>, and the <i>power to obey or
disobey</i> the requirements of moral law. Both these conditions
of accountability exist in man. By virtue of his
constitution as a spiritual being made in the image of God,
he is capable of perceiving what is inherently right, just,
and good. His reason intuitively apprehends the good,
and affirms the imperative obligation to choose the good.
His judgment pronounces upon the relation of human conduct
to the law of right, affirming man has or has not done
right. And his emotive nature yields him complacence
and joy as the reward of well-doing, or inflicts pain and
remorse as the punishment of wrong-doing. In the words
of Chalmers, "he is endowed with a conscience which performs
within his bosom all the offices of a lawgiver and a
judge."</p>

<p>The possession of this faculty necessarily supposes the
existence of power in the agent to comply or not to comply
with its behests. A moral law is designed only for
the government of a free being, and nothing is moral or
immoral which is not voluntary. If there is no self-determination,
there is no proper personality to which the law
of reason can attach. Remorse, on the one hand, satisfaction
on the other, are emotions which are inconceivable
and impossible in a being who is not consciously free.</p>

<p><i>The nature and authority of conscience</i> is a question
which is earnestly discussed. Among philosophers and
theologians there are diverse and conflicting opinions. It
has been variously characterized as a <i>witness</i> of our past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
actions; as a <i>judgment</i> passed upon our actions; or as a
<i>feeling</i> arising in view of our actions. By one, conscience
is regarded as an <i>appetite</i>&mdash;a craving for the right, but
not a faculty intuitively perceiving the right. Another
defines it "as a <i>capacity</i> and a <i>tendency</i> to inquire into
duty, but not as supplying a law of duty."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> While a
third regards it as a state of the <i>sensibility</i>&mdash;"a simple
feeling, emotion, or vivid sentiment which arises immediately
in the mind in presence of certain actions, and to
which we give the name of moral approbation."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>These definitions of conscience may all be regarded as
containing some truth. They are all defective, however,
in this one respect&mdash;<i>they fail to recognize an internal law
which constitutes a subjective standard of right</i>, and an
intuitive perception of moral distinctions and qualities in
human action.</p>

<p>As an essay toward a clearer apprehension of the nature
of conscience, we present the following propositions:</p>

<p>1. <i>Conscience is not a distinct faculty of the mind.</i>
Conscience (<i>conscientia</i> = joint or double knowledge) is
the knowledge of self in relation to a known law of right
and wrong. Conscience and consciousness may therefore
be regarded as, in some respects, identical. The terms in
their etymology and their general import are synonymous.
There is, however, a technical distinction to be made.
Consciousness expresses self-knowledge in general. Conscience
expresses self-knowledge relative to responsibility.
Consciousness is the recognition by the thinking subject of
its own states and affections. Conscience is the knowledge
of an act or an affection as having some moral quality&mdash;as
being right or wrong.</p>

<p>2. <i>Conscience is, like consciousness, a complex phenom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>enon</i>,
the result of the simultaneous action of the primary
powers of the mind. The simplest fact of consciousness
is a synthesis of sensation and reason in a primitive psychological
judgment. Sensation alone is not knowledge,
and it becomes consciousness only as it is illuminated and
informed by the reason. And so a mere state of the sensibility&mdash;a
mere feeling of approbation or disapprobation&mdash;does
not constitute conscience until it is informed by the
reason. Conscience is the unity of feeling and reason in
a judgment which has respect to voluntary action.</p>

<p>3. <i>Conscience is the common field in which is revealed
the result of the operation of all our faculties in their
especial relation to moral law.</i> As consciousness is the
common field in which the results of the operation of all
our faculties come to light, so conscience is that department
of the same field in which is revealed the action of
the mind in relation to the unchangeable principles of order
and right which dwell in the bosom of the Infinite.
Conscience is pre-eminently the Godward side of our mental
being, which reflects the moral character of God, and
brings us into relationship with Him. It is that which
carries us <i>per saltum</i> to the immediate recognition of a
God, the Lawgiver and the Judge who is over man, and
which holds him in mysterious but indissoluble bonds of
obligation. Conscience is therefore,</p>

<p>(1.) The <i>reason</i> intuitively apprehending universal moral
ideas and laws. It furnishes <i>the idea of the good</i>. It affirms
that the good is universally <i>obligatory</i>. It asserts
that the good has <i>desert</i>, worthiness, and dignity. And it
demands for the good an appropriate recognition and a
just reward.</p>

<p>(2.) The <i>understanding</i> apprehending the relations in
which we stand to God, to our fellow-beings, and to self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
as a moral personality endowed with reason and freedom.</p>

<p>(3.) The <i>judgment</i> comparing the acts of a voluntary
agent existing in certain relations with the immutable
ideas and laws of the reason, and affirming this is <i>right</i>
and worthy of praise and reward, or that is <i>wrong</i> and deserving
of blame and punishment.</p>

<p>(4.) A particular state of the <i>sensibility</i>&mdash;the painful or
pleasurable emotions which spontaneously arise in presence
of right or wrong in our own actions or in the actions of
our fellow-men.</p>

<p>Thus conscience is, as it were, the focal point at which
are united and blended the varied acts and states of the
soul in its immediate relation to the moral law. It is the
synthesis of moral ideas, cognitions, and feelings in a moral
judgment.</p>

<p>The co-operation of these powers and susceptibilities of
the soul in their relation to the <i>good</i> has a parallel and an
illustration in their operation in relation to the <i>beautiful</i>.</p>

<p>The ideas of order, proportion, harmony, fitness, and unity
in variety are unquestionably fundamental and necessary
ideas of the <i>reason</i>. In the Divine reason these
ideas have always existed as the laws in accordance with
which He fashioned the material universe. And inasmuch
as the human reason is configured to the Divine, these
ideas must also exist in the human mind. Like statuary in
the inner palaces of the soul, they are the models by which
we recognize and the standards according to which we
judge the forms of beauty in the external world. The
correspondence between these external forms and the inner
ideals of the reason is recognized by the <i>judgment</i>.
And the delight we experience in presence of the beauti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>ful
in nature and art is a particular direction of the <i>sensibility</i>.</p>

<p>This is not, however, the chronological order in which
the idea of the beautiful is developed in the mind. The
sense of beauty first reveals itself in the spontaneous consciousness
in presence of the order and harmony and
fitness which pervade the universe. We experience delight
without being able to specialize the precise causes of
our pleasure. But the reflective consciousness, which is
pre-eminently analytic, brings out into clear light the fundamental
ideas of order, harmony, fitness, and unity, which
had a prior existence in the reason, and have now recognized
themselves as mirrored in the universe. The repeated
observation of the forms of beauty around us, and
the comparison of these with the standard ideas of the
reason, will result in the beau-ideal of a pure and correct
taste&mdash;true αἰσθητικόν.</p>

<p>So in relation to the idea of the <i>good</i>. It does not
stand forth to the eye of consciousness, in the first instance,
as an abstract conception. The <i>moral sense</i>&mdash;the
affection of the sensibility in presence of voluntary and
responsible action&mdash;is first revealed in the spontaneous
consciousness. When we behold an act of justice, of kindness,
of beneficence, we experience the fullest satisfaction.
We admire and esteem the actor. We feel that his conduct
is praiseworthy, and that he is deserving of honor
and reward. These sentiments spring up spontaneously
and involuntarily in our bosoms long before we have defined
their reason and law. The reflective consciousness
subsequently elicits the rational ideas which underlie these
emotions&mdash;the ideas of the useful, the just, the beneficent,
the noble, and the perfect, all which are finally embraced
in the idea of the <i>good</i>. And the repeated com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>parison
of the conduct of voluntary agents existing under
certain relations, with the fundamental ideas of the reason,
these standards of right erected in the soul, will result in
an ideal of moral excellence&mdash;a true ἐθικόν.</p>

<p>If this doctrine of conscience be the product of a true
psychological method, it will enable us to account for the
apparent want of uniformity in its suffrages in individual
cases, and the varied phenomena presented in different
men.</p>

<p>Conscience, like consciousness, has its gradual development.
Though natural and necessary to every human
soul whose powers are normally developed, it is not exercised
at the beginning of its existence, but only after certain
conditions of growth and stages of growth have been
attained. This development may be arrested or it may be
perverted. The absence of proper conditions, the lack of
suitable discipline and culture in any one of the faculties
whose operation enters into the concrete phenomena, will
modify the general result. An excess of <i>sensibility</i> will
give a morbid conscience; the lack of sensibility, a slumbering
conscience. A defective apprehension of the relations
in which we stand to God and to our fellow-men will
prevent our seeing our specific duties. Inattention to the
character of our own motives, or ignorance of the real intentions
of other men, may mislead the <i>judgment</i> in discriminating
between the quality of actions. There are
also natural differences in the soundness and accuracy of
the judgments of individual men. We meet those who
with a limited acquaintance with particular facts and abstract
notions are nevertheless endowed with sound practical
judgment; while others, with a larger knowledge of
facts and general principles, are strangely defective in
judgment. Finally, unless men accustom themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
reflection, to analysis, the ideas of the just, the right, the
good, do not come clearly into the light of consciousness.
Hence the different manifestations of conscience in individual
men.</p>

<p>We claim, however, that the moral ideas of the reason
are in all men <i>identical</i>; that they exist and operate, even
though unconsciously, in all minds, determining their moral
judgments; and that <i>when the same relations of personality
are clearly before the mind the moral judgments
of men are uniform</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of all the topical moralities to which factitious
circumstances may have given birth, there is unquestionably
<i>a universal and immutable morality</i>. In every nation
under heaven, veracity, justice, and beneficence are
separated by a clear, unmistakable line from falsehood,
injustice, and cruelty; nor can all the casuistry and sophistry
in the universe transpose or confound them. Custom,
prescription, conventions of human opinion, factitious
circumstances, can never blur over and obliterate these
lines which separate right and wrong. Beneath all these
apparent differences, the conscience will make her voice
heard in the depth of the soul, in the common sentiments
of mankind, and in the statutes of universal jurisprudence.
The great ideas of justice and right were prominent and
well defined among the nations of antiquity. "Nemesis
and Themis were not only their abstractions and deities&mdash;they
were embodied in their systems of jurisprudence.
Law secured property and sanctified life. Law guarded
every relation and ordered every act. Law was the theme
of their philosophy and the burden of their song. We are
not unacquainted with the jealousies and disputes of their
schools of philosophy. They placed the good of man and
the reason of morality in the most incongruous things, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
<i>they never differed concerning the conduct which was
right</i>. Epicurus and Zeno knew no divergence here."<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
Indeed, they asserted the immutability of moral law for
all times and places&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The unwritten laws of God that know not change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are not of to-day nor yesterday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But live for ever."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There is," says Cicero, "one true and original law, conformable
to nature and reason, diffused over all, invariable,
eternal, which calls to the fulfillment of duty and to abstinence
from injustice, and which calls with that irresistible
voice which is felt in all its authority wherever it is heard.
This law can not be curtailed or abolished, nor affected in
its sanctions by any law of man. A whole senate, a whole
people, can not dispense with its paramount obligation.
It requires no commentator to render it distinctly intelligible,
nor is it different at Rome, at Athens, now and in
ages before and after, but in all ages and all nations it is
and has been and will be one and everlasting&mdash;one as
that God, its author and promulgator, who is the common
Sovereign of all mankind, is Himself one. Man is truly
man as he yields himself to this Divine influence. He can
not resist it but by flying, as it were, from his own bosom,
and laying aside the general feelings of humanity, by
which very act he must already have inflicted on himself
the severest of punishments, even though he were to avoid
what is usually accounted punishment."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Among the most savage tribes, as among the most refined
and polished nations, are also to be found the same
common principles of morality. Theft, murder, adultery
are offenses condemned and punished by every nation un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>der
heaven. The high qualities of virtue are the things
which win esteem and command respect in every country,
however rude. Were proof demanded, we might bring it
at once from the darkest corners of the earth. The savage
Fijian regards theft, adultery, abduction, incendiarism,
and treason as serious crimes.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> And Dr. Livingstone tells
us that, "On questioning intelligent men among the Backwains
as to their former knowledge of good and evil, of
God, and of a future state, they have scouted the idea of
any of them ever having been without a tolerably clear
conception on all these subjects. Respecting their sense
of right and wrong, they profess that nothing we indicate
as sin ever appeared to them as otherwise, except the
statement that it was wrong to have more wives than
one."<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>We conclude that the universal consciousness of our
race, as revealed in human history, languages, legislations,
and sentiments, bears testimony to the fact that the ideas
of right, duty, accountability, and moral desert are native
to the human mind; and consequently the existence of the
first condition of moral government&mdash;namely, the possession
by its subject of a <i>conscience</i>&mdash;is an unquestionable fact.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> condition of moral government is the existence,
in the subject, <i>of free self-determining power</i>: the
agent must be the real cause and the sole cause of his own
actions; he must have freedom both <i>to</i> and <i>from</i> the act.</p>

<p>Under a reign of necessity there can be no moral government
and no just retribution. It is, at best, a mere
physical or natural government; for moral government
must be of beings who are free and self-determined, and
not of mere machines. To blame a necessitated thing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
irrational, to punish it is a cruelty and an injustice. The
necessitarian himself is unable to conceal his conscious
embarrassment in presence of these difficulties, and to save
his theory he becomes reckless in assertions. He affirms
that "the whole system of morality&mdash;its duties and responsibilities;
the whole scheme of moral government, with its
rewards and punishments&mdash;remains, on his theory, as entire
and stable as ever."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> This affirmation runs athwart all
the dictates of common-sense, and collides with the universal
conviction of humanity. He is the only consistent
necessitarian who rejects the Christian doctrine of sin, denies
all accountability and retribution, and reduces the
government of God to mere physical impulsion and the
management of a universal mechanism. The necessitarian
dogma can not be made to quadrate with our primitive
convictions; it is out of harmony with all our instinctive
beliefs. The innate idea of right, the native sense of duty
and accountability, the consciousness of sin, our faith in
the justice of God, our religious hopes and fears, all impel
us onward to find a rational and valid basis for human
responsibility and moral government in the freedom of
the will.</p>

<p>That man does possess an alternative power of self-determination
and choice is evident:</p>

<p>1. <i>From the direct testimony of consciousness.</i> We
<i>know</i> that any doing of ours might have been reserved&mdash;we
<i>feel</i>, by that same direct consciousness which certifies
our existence and our reason, that we have the fullest
power of choice. No subtlety, no abstraction of argument,
can convince us that we are otherwise than free.
"Men are not conscious of compulsion of any kind, not
conscious of certain mental states, called choices, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
are either wholly or partially independent of their free
agency; but they are perfectly and distinctly conscious of
entire liberty, and of complete inward power to choose."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>That we have a direct consciousness of freedom is the
doctrine of most of the writers on moral science. Cousin
is emphatic in the assertion of this doctrine: "I am conscious
of this sovereign power of the will. I feel in myself,
before its determination, the force that can determine
itself in such a manner or in such another. At the same
time that I will this or that I am equally conscious of the
power to will the opposite; I am conscious of being master
of my resolution, of the ability to arrest it, continue it,
repress it."<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The distinguished Professor of Moral Philosophy
in the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Calderwood,
teaches the same doctrine: "It is in our consciousness of
self-control for the determination of activity that we obtain
our only knowledge of causation. Every one knows
himself as the cause of his own actions. In the external
world we continue ignorant of causes, and are able only
to trace uniform sequence, as Hume and Comte have insisted.
But in consciousness we distinguish between sequence
and causality. We are conscious of our own
causal energy by knowing the origin of our activity in
self-determination."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>The direct consciousness of freedom is denied by Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
William Hamilton. This denial is a necessary consequence
of his doctrine of relativity. If we are not conscious of self
as a reality, but only of certain modes or affections, then,
of course, we can not be conscious of self as a free power.
But as Mansel has forcibly replied: "Does it not rather
appear a flat contradiction to maintain that I am not immediately
conscious of myself, but only of my sensations
or volitions? Who, then, is the <i>I</i> that is conscious; and
how can <i>I</i> be conscious of such states as <i>mine</i>? In this
case it would surely be more accurate to say, not that I
am conscious of my sensations, but that the sensation is
conscious of itself; but, thus worded, the glaring absurdity
of the theory would carry with it its own refutation....
Self-personality is revealed to us with all the clearness of
an original intuition."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> With an inconsistency which
shows the fallacy of Sir William Hamilton's whole theory
of relativity, he admits that, "As clearly as I am conscious
of existing, so clearly am I conscious at every moment of
my existence that the conscious Ego is not itself a mere
modification, nor a series of modifications of any other
subject, but that it is itself something different from all its
own modifications, and a <i>self-subsistent entity</i>."<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>If, then, we admit, as we must admit, the existence of an
immediate consciousness, not merely of the phenomena of
mind, but of the personal self as actively and passively
related to them, we must also admit the direct testimony
of conscience to the fact of liberty. "I am conscious not
merely of the phenomenon of volition, <i>but of myself as
producing it, and as producing it by choice, with a power
to choose the opposite alternative</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>The necessitarians are all compelled to concede that the
universal conviction of our race is, and always has been,
that man is free. They have, however, asserted that this
dictate of common-sense is not to be accepted as philosophically
true. Lord Kames admits the natural conviction
of freedom from necessity, though he declares it to be
an illusion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Man fondly dreams that he is free to act;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught is he but the powerless, worthless plaything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the blind force that in his will itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Works out for him a dread necessity."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Hommel, certainly one of the ablest and most decided
of fatalists, says, "I must believe that I have a feeling
of liberty, at the very moment I am writing against
liberty, upon grounds which I regard as incontestable.
Zeno was a fatalist only in theory; he did not act in conformity
with his convictions."<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The possession of alternative power is a fact of consciousness
as clear and indubitable as the fact of personal
existence. It is admitted by the necessitarians that all men
have "a natural conviction of freedom;" they believe themselves
to be free beings, and they act upon this belief in
all the relations of life. If this fact of consciousness is an
illusion, then our existence is also an illusion, for that same
intuition which certifies to me that I exist certifies also
that I am free. If the testimony of consciousness is invalidated,
there is no criterion for truth. If one of its deliverances
is found to be false, how can we vindicate the
veracity of any? "Our faculties are bestowed upon us as
the instruments of deception; the root of our nature is a
lie, and universal skepticism is the only goal."</p>

<p>2. <i>The idea of moral obligation necessarily presupposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
the freedom of the will.</i> This is a principle so obvious
that it needs no elucidation. If man have duties, he must
possess the power of fulfilling them. He ought to be free
if he ought to obey law, or human nature is in contradiction
with itself. The direct certainty of obligation implies
the corresponding certainty of freedom. Hence Kant's
well-known canon, "<i>I ought, therefore I can.</i>" Though
denying the direct consciousness of freedom, Kant maintained
with earnestness that the fact of liberty is guaranteed
by the existence of the moral law, whose categorical
imperative <i>thou shalt</i> necessarily implies a corresponding
<i>thou canst</i>. To the same effect are the words of Sir William
Hamilton: "The fact that we are free is given to us
in the consciousness of an uncompromising law of duty....
Our consciousness of the moral law, which without a
moral liberty in man would be a mendacious imperative,
gives a decided preponderance to the doctrine of freedom
over the doctrine of fate."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Physical causation and moral
obligation can not coexist side by side. In proportion as
we extend the domain of necessity we must diminish that
of duty.</p>

<p>3. <i>The sense of responsibility presupposes the freedom
of the will.</i> This sense of responsibility is native to the
human mind. Every man feels himself to be accountable
for his own conduct, not only at the bar of his own conscience,
but before the moral judgment-seat of his fellow-men.
Every where he recognizes the right of his fellow-men
to inquire into his character, to sit in judgment upon
his conduct, and to esteem and treat him accordingly. We
necessarily impute blame when an unjust action is performed
by another; we feel conscious of guilt and unworthiness
when a wrong is done by ourselves. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
are facts of universal consciousness. But these sentiments
are irrational and absurd if man is a mere machine impelled
by natural causes, and has no self-determining power.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
Whatever disasters may overtake us in the course of
nature, however we may suffer by the wild tornado or the
blighting mildew, how much soever of our property may be
swallowed up by the ocean tempest or the devouring flame,
we impute no blame; and we experience here emotions essentially
different from those which we experience when a
wrong is intentionally inflicted upon us by our fellow-men.
"Suppose yourself to have been the victim of some act of injustice
and villainy by which you were reduced to penury,
and your family to want and indigence. By what philosophy
can you eradicate the sense of wrong or cease to impute
blame to the man whose perfidy has despoiled your
life? You may forgive him, and follow him with your
prayers to the last hour of your life, but you will still pray
for him as a guilty man whose crime has been the burden
of your life." Now what is this radical and fundamental
difference between the events of the material universe
and the actions of men? and what is the rational basis
for the different feelings we experience and the diverse
judgments we pass in regard to them?</p>

<p>There is only one answer to this question. The ultimate
ground-difference is found in the fact that one class
of events is <i>necessary</i>&mdash;there is no adequate power in the
thing to be or do otherwise; the other class of actions is
<i>free</i>&mdash;they need not have been performed, the actor had
full power for a contrary choice. In the world of nature
<i>force</i> reigns; in the world of moral life <i>liberty</i> prevails.
The fundamental principle of difference is the <i>freedom
of the will</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>
<p>This second condition of moral government&mdash;namely,
the possession of <i>free alternative power</i> on the part of the
subject to comply, or refuse to comply, with the requirements
of moral law&mdash;is thus established, first, by the direct
testimony of consciousness, from which there can be no
appeal, and, secondly, by necessary inference from collateral
facts of consciousness, which can not be invalidated
by counter-proofs.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the restlessness of speculative minds, the
necessities of false theories in philosophy, or the unwarrantable
assumptions of dogmatic theologians, have led to
the disregard of the affirmations of universal consciousness.
Men have asked, How can freedom be possible in a
dependent creature? How can it be consistent with our
belief in the principle of universal causation? How can
it be harmonized with the fact that man always acts under
the influence of motives? How can it be reconciled with
the omnipotence and absolute prescience of God?</p>

<p>We shall now address ourselves to the consideration of
the arguments against the doctrine of the freedom of the
will which are suggested by these queries.</p>


<p>1. The first is the <i>Metaphysical or Causational Argument</i>.
The rational intuition that "every event must
have a cause" is a universal and necessary truth. It must
therefore be rigorously applied to all mental as well as to
all physical phenomena. Every volition must have a cause,
and if caused it can not be <i>free</i>. This is the grand argument
upon which the necessitarian mainly relies, and it is
urged with eloquence and force by Edwards, Chalmers,
and McCosh.</p>

<p>Now that "every event must have a cause" is an <i>à
priori</i> truth, which is as readily accorded by the free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>domist
as it is vehemently insisted upon by the necessitarian.
No philosophic writers have more ably and clearly
enounced this law of causality than the freedomists Reid,
Stewart, and Cousin. They rely upon it as one of the
main pillars of the Theistic argument. And they apply it,
in all its integrity, to mental as well as to physical phenomena.
They hesitate not to say that "<i>every volition must
have a cause</i>." That cause is the efficient creative power
which resides in a free, spiritual personality. And that
power is not, like a material or physical cause, shut up to
one sole mode of effectuation: it is an <i>alternative</i> power,
a pluri-efficient cause. Where, then, is the discrepancy
between the universal principle of causality and the doctrine
of alternative causation? Is the infinite First Cause
confined to one solely possible mode of effectuation? If
so, how will you account for the endlessly varied effects
which appear in the physical universe? God is the Eternal
<i>One</i>; whence the plurality and diversity of his creative
acts if He be not an equipotent cause? And yet, of
all the events which have transpired in the universe, whether
natural or supernatural, we affirm "every event must
have had a cause."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> The endless diversity of effects which
originate in the alternative causation of God is in perfect
harmony with this universal law of causality.</p>

<p>But on a closer examination it will be found that when
the necessitarian attempts to invalidate our consciousness
of alternative power by the application of the causational
argument he adroitly shifts his ground. He assumes another
proposition, which is neither equivalent to the above axiom,
nor in itself axiomatic and self-evident, nor justifiably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
assumed without proof. McCosh says "the doctrine of
necessity is founded on the intellectual intuitions of man's
mind, which lead us, in mental as in material phenomena,
to anticipate the <i>same</i> effects to follow the <i>same</i> causes"<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>&mdash;that
is, every cause is inalternative or unipotent; one
effect, and only one can follow.</p>

<p>Now that a given phenomenon must have a cause is one
assertion; that the <i>same</i> cause will again and forever produce
the <i>same</i> effect is another. The first is an axiom, the
second is an induction. That "every event must have a
cause" is a rational intuition. That "like causes will produce
always like effects" is a generalization from our limited
experience, and on a further analysis will be found
to apply only to our cognitions of the <i>material</i> universe.
It is grounded simply on what we know empirically of the
uniformity of nature. Now we have no <i>à priori</i> intuitive
conviction of the uniformity of nature. As the result of
maturer thought, McCosh admits this in his work on the
"Intuitions of the Mind:" "It is vain to speak of the belief
in the uniformity of nature as a self-evident, a necessary,
or a universal truth" (page 276). It is perfectly conceivable
that the world might have been so constituted
that there should have been no regularity in the succession
of events. The causes of all the events in nature
might have been <i>supernatural</i>, and consisted in the immediate
free volitions of the Deity, or subordinate angelic
agencies.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> They might have been all "miraculous," and
yet the true law of causality would not have been violated,
or in any way invalidated. And so when man, in the
exercise of his free alternative power, produces a new suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>cession
of events in physical nature, or moves disorder and
ἀνομία into the moral sphere, this is no way inconsistent
with the axiom that "every event has a cause."</p>

<p>"In our very definition of freedom of will we assume in
the volitional sphere the inapplicability of the maxim that
'like causes ever and always produce like effects.' We
assume that <i>either</i> one of several effects is legitimate from
the <i>same</i> cause. And while we admit that in non-volitional
causation the law that 'every event must have a cause'
means that every event must have its own peculiar cause,
adequate for itself alone, in volitional causation an event
may have a cause adequate either for it or for other event;
and whichever event exists, the <i>demands of the laws of
causation are completely satisfied</i>."<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>Driven from this boasted stronghold, the necessitarian
resorts to his favorite dialectic strategy. He demands the
explanation of equipotent causation, how one cause can be
adequate to several effects. He asks, <i>What causes the
will to put forth one particular volition rather than
another?</i></p>

<p>Now when we have shown that, as a fact of consciousness
and experience, a personal, <i>spiritual</i> cause is adequate
to several results, we are entitled in reason and justice to
protest against any attempt to push the inquiry a step farther.
We have attained an ultimate fact, and we have no
right to cast doubt upon its authority by raising perplexing
questions as to the <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> of that which <i>is</i>. This is
precisely the method by which the atheist Holyoake would
invalidate the argument for the existence of the infinite
First Cause. He subjects the Deity to this universal law
of causality, and asks, What caused the Creator to create?
"The atheist holds that the universe is an endless series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
causes and effects <i>ad infinitum</i>, and therefore the idea of
a <i>first</i> cause is an absurdity and a contradiction." The
"infinite series" of Edwards and of Holyoake are constructed
on the same principle. They both ask <i>a</i> cause
for <i>the</i> cause.</p>

<p>When, therefore, it is asked, What causes the will to
effect one volition rather than another? our answer is,
<i>Nothing whatever!</i></p>

<p>"Of its own effect, <span class="smcap">WILL</span>, in its proper conditions, is not
a partial, but a full and adequate cause. Put your finger
upon any effect (volition) and ask, What caused this result
exclusively of the others? and the reply is, The will, or the
agent in willing. Ask then what caused the will in its
conditions to cause the volition, and the reply is, <span class="smcap">Nothing</span>.
Nay, you are a bad philosopher in asking; for for its
own effect will or the willing agent is a complete cause:
as complete a cause as any cause whatever; <i>and every
complete cause produces its effect</i> <span class="smcap">UNCAUSEDLY</span>. The volition,
like every other effect, is completely accounted for
when a complete cause is assigned. To ask what caused
the complete cause to produce the effect is to ask the cause
of causation."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>But such an "alternative" power, the necessitarian affirms,
is incomprehensible and inexplicable. To which we
need only reply in the language of Hamilton, "The scheme
of freedom is not more incomprehensible than the scheme
of necessity."<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> "<i>Omnia exeunt in mysterium</i>"&mdash;there is
nothing the absolute ground of which is not a mystery.
In saying so much, however, we by no means grant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
affirmation of Hamilton that "we are unable to conceive
an absolute commencement [of being or motion]; we can
not therefore conceive a free volition."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> This is not admitted
by Mansel, the disciple and annotator of Hamilton,
as flowing even from his mental "law of the conditioned."
"It may be true, as a fact, that no material atom has been
added to the world since the first creation; but the assertion,
however true, is certainly not <i>necessary</i>. The Power
which created once must be conceived as able to create
again, whether that ability is actually exercised or not.
The same conclusion is still more evident when we proceed
from the consideration of matter to that of mind. Of
matter we maintain that the creation of new portions is perfectly
conceivable as a result, if not as a process. Every
man who comes into the world comes into it as a distinct individual,
having a personality and consciousness of his own;
and that personality is a distinct accession to the number
of persons previously existing.... I believe that every
new person that comes into the world is, as a person, a
new existence."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> So a volition is a <i>new</i> existence, an absolute
origination, "a beginning of motion" which has its
source in the primordial power of the human spirit as spirit.
The <i>fact</i> is undeniable, the <i>mode</i> is inexplicable. But
the inconceivability of the mode in which the will creates a
volition no more renders the fact doubtful than the impossibility
of conceiving how a new and distinct self-conscious
personality comes into existence invalidates the fact that "I
exist, and know myself as a distinctly existing being."</p>


<p>2. <i>The Psychological Argument.</i>&mdash;This may be briefly
stated in the following terms:</p>

<p>It is a fact of observation and experience that <i>motives</i> do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
stand to the will in the relation of <i>causes</i> which necessitate
volition. They have an exact mathematical commensurability,
and their prevalence is in the precise ratio of their
antecedent intrinsic <i>strength</i>. If motives are wanting,
there can be no choice; but when the same motives are
presented to the same mind, it obeys them with such remarkable
<i>uniformity</i> that human actions may be reduced
to statistical tables as reliable and as accurate as tables of
mortality.</p>

<p>We might here at once, and with justice, enter our caveat
against the attempt to invalidate a primitive datum of
consciousness by alleged deductions from the exterior phenomena
of human life and history. A primitive datum of
consciousness is unquestionable and infallible. A process
of induction is liable to the interpolations of error. The
latter is therefore a lesser authority than the former, and
a merely derivative assurance can not be argued against an
ultimate fact. We must regard it as a philosophic canon
that an experience cognition can not conflict with an intuitive
belief. The exterior phenomena of life and history,
properly interpreted, must harmonize with the interior
facts and laws of the human mind, for what is <i>history</i>
but the development, under the conditions and relations of
time, of the primitive powers, ideas, and laws of humanity?
If, then, consciousness attests the presence in man's spiritual
nature of a power, in the same circumstances, to choose
either of several ways, we may confidently expect that the
phenomena of the moral world will not belie that testimony.
Now it is a palpable fact that an unbroken law of
continuity and uniformity pervades the material universe.
It is locked up in an unchangeable status. There is no deviation
and no progression. All things remain as they were
since the beginning. The fundamental fact lying at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
basis of this undeviating uniformity of nature is that
material causes are unipotent, and shut up to one solely
possible mode of effectuation.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> And it is equally palpable
that the phenomena of the moral world, the sphere of
human life and history, reveal contingency, diversity, alteriety,
and progression. Humanity has not revolved in
cycles, neither has it run in the inflexible grooves of an anterior
causation, nor remained in the dead-lock of an unchangeable
status. History is not an inflexible frame-work
in which all events have been shaped by necessity; it is a
development of the inherent powers and capabilities of humanity,
and it teaches us that new trains of causes have
been originated, and new conditions have been superinduced
by man. The ground-fact which underlies all the
diversity, contingency, and progress which appear in the
moral world is that volitional causes are equipotent and
efficient for any one of the several results.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> In moral development
the progressive principle is just the freedom of
the will. The facts of the inner and outer world are therefore
in harmony.</p>

<p>The theory of the necessitarian assumes that the will is
a mere passivity, a simple conductor of the impulse which
motive power exerts, a mere transition-point where ideal
force is transformed into physical force, and desires, inclinations,
moral convictions, divine influences become necessary
acts. Motives thus prevail by their antecedent intrinsic
power just as physical forces prevail in mechanical
and vital dynamics. And, proceeding upon this assumption,
he labors to construct a science of Ethology in which
he would anticipate human action by statistics, and show
how individual character <i>must</i> be in accordance with
physical and mental causation. Whereas consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
asserts that the will "is not a bleak mechanical thing."
It is a free alternative power. It is a full, complete, adequate
cause. It is <i>spirit</i>, not matter.</p>

<p>Now it is freely granted that the mind acts in view of
motives, acts in accordance with motives, acts in a certain
qualified sense under the influence of motives; <i>but the
freedomist emphatically denies that the will is necessitated
to action by motives</i>. Motives may be reason <i>for</i>
action, conditions under which will acts, but they are not
causes <i>of</i> action. They may solicit, invite, urge to action,
but they can not constrain, compel, and force action.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>Motives have no fixed correlation to the will. They address
themselves to the feelings, the judgment, the conscience,
and not directly and immediately to the will.
They may awaken desire, fear, inclination, preference, a
sense of obligation; but these are all states of the intellect
and sensibility, and may coexist in the same mind with a
state of indetermination and non-differentiation in the will.
That which is desirable may appeal to the feelings, that
which is eligible to the judgment, that which is obligatory
to the conscience, and these may excite the mind in different
degrees of intensity; but none of them have power to
move the will. We may be able intellectually to perceive
that some motives are intrinsically "higher" than others,
that some have a prevolition power to excite all minds
more intensely than others; but they do not prevail and
secure action in any ratio with their supposed <i>à priori</i>
strength. They can only become real motives for the
will by its voluntary placing its interest in them and
making them objects of its choice.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> All the actual
strength which a motive has is derived from the action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
of the will. On this subject we offer the following propositions:</p>

<p>(1.) <i>The so-called strength of a motive is the degree of
probability that the will will act in accordance with or
on account of it.</i> "And it is most important to remark
that the <i>result</i> is not always, nor in most cases, necessarily
as the <i>highest probability</i>. The will may choose for the
higher or for the lower. And as the will may choose for
a lower rather than a higher probability, so the will may
choose on account of what is called antecedently a <i>weaker</i>
over a <i>stronger</i> motive. And hereby is once for all established
the difference between mechanical force and motive
influence&mdash;that whereas in the former, by necessity,
the greater effect results from the greater force, in the
latter the less is possible from the greater, the greater from
the less."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> That result is not as the highest probability
Dr. Whedon has shown most conclusively from the
doctrine of Contingencies or Probabilities. And on this
he grounds his doctrine of <i>contingent motive probability</i>.
"This contingent character of motive influence is correspondent
with the alternative character of that which is
its sole possible object&mdash;will. An alternative will and a
contingent motive influence are correlatives. They mutually
explain and sustain each other. To admit either is to
admit both. And so a unipotent will and a necessary motive
influence are correlatives. He who is compelled to
admit one is compelled to admit the other. It will be a
mere controversy about a word to say that an influence
which does not produce effect is no influence. That may
legitimately be called an influence, it is important to add,
which is conceived as <i>possessing an intrinsic probability
for result, though the higher probability be a contingency</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
for which there exists power of <i>failure</i>. If so, then the
doctrine of contingent motive influence is established, and
the doctrine of volitional necessity is at an end. The relation
between physical force and effect is <i>necessity</i>. The
relation between motive and volition is <i>contingency</i>."<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>(2.) <i>The so-called strength of a motive is the comparative
prevalence which the will assigns to it by its own
action.</i> It is impossible to erect any standard by which
the intrinsic "strength" of motives can be determined previous
to volition. "A cold intellection is not intrinsically
commensurable with a deep emotion, nor a sentiment of
taste with a feeling of obligation, nor a physical appetite
with a sense of honor." Now by what standard can the
comparative force of these influences be determined?
There is no more commensurability between them than
between "the brightness of day and the force of magnetic
attractions." Or if we could possibly determine, by some
rational <i>à priori</i> method, that a feeling of obligation is
intrinsically stronger than a physical appetite, or that the
love of life is stronger <i>per se</i> than a sense of duty, we
can not affirm that the one or the other shall therefore
uniformly and necessarily prevail. These influences derive
all their prevalency, and consequently their comparative
strength of motive, <i>from the will alone</i>. The will
places its interest in the one or the other. It decides the
mental position. "It settles the question of preferences
between alternatives, dismisses the counter-motive from
view, and closes the debate."<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>The "strength" of a motive, in its relation to the will,
can only be known by the test of <i>prevalency</i>. This is unwittingly
conceded by the necessitarian. He says "the
strongest motive prevails because that is the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
which the will chooses." This really concedes the position
assumed by Dr. Whedon, that "the strength of a motive
is the comparative prevalence which the will, in its own
action, assigns to it, or the nearness to which the will
comes to acting on account of it." Men do not always
choose that which is most <i>desirable</i>, nor that which is most
<i>eligible</i>, nor that which appears most <i>obligatory</i>. But
from whatever motive men may choose to act, however
base and unworthy, the necessitarian affirms it was intrinsically
the strongest motive <i>because</i> it was chosen; which
simply amounts to this&mdash;the strongest motive is always
chosen because the motive chosen is always the strongest
motive.</p>

<p>The attempts of the necessitarian to fix upon some
standard by which to estimate the antecedent strength of
motives have all signally failed. The most plausible is
that of Edwards. He asserts that the volition is always
as the greatest <i>apparent</i> good. But by what standard is
that good estimated, by which faculty is it recognized and
pronounced <i>good</i>? by the reason, the conscience, the judgment,
or the appetites? Can that be pronounced <i>good</i>
which is chosen in obedience to passion and lust? Does
the man who inflicts a premeditated injury upon his neighbor
choose the greatest apparent good? Does the murderer
believe that in taking away the life of his fellow-man
"the volition is as the greatest apparent good?"
Certainly not. "Never," says Bushnell, "was there a case
of wrong, a sinful choice, in which the agent believed he
was choosing for the strongest, weightiest, or most valuable
motives." The great mass of sinful men are conscious
of choosing sinful indulgence against their "highest good."</p>

<p>(3.) <i>Motives are the conditions, but not the causes of volition.</i>
"Of volition the cause, the sole cause, is will. Mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>tives
are collateral conditions ... for the volition to be;
with which there is adequate power for the volition not
to be.... The motive is only the <i>occasion</i>, and all its acts of
excitement amount to no more than this, that they stand
as <i>probable conditions</i> opening the way toward which the
will thereby acquires opportunity to act with full adequate
power of not acting."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The relation between motive and
volition is not a necessary but a contingent relation. The
will is the controlling conscious self in the exercise of direct
causative power in producing volition.</p>

<p>Some modern writers of the necessitarian school, McCosh
for example, admit the existence of "self-activity" in the
will. But what can be the meaning of "self-activity" if
the will have not the power of either resisting or yielding
to motives presented, and in the same unchanged circumstances
of choosing a different alternative? To be moved
absolutely by motives is not <i>self</i>-movement. A power to
move in only one given direction is a mere nature-force;
it can not be self-activity. The distinguished writer above
named also admits that "<i>causation in the will is entirely
different from causation in other actions</i>."<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> If he mean
that motives act upon the will in a manner "entirely different"
from that by which physical causes secure action
or change in the material world, what right has he to call
it <i>causation</i> at all? And if he mean that volitional
causation is "alternative," and not, like physical causation,
"unipotent," then the controversy is at an end.</p>

<p>(4.) <i>We have no such experience of "uniformities of volition"
as shall enable us to generalize a universal law
of volitional causation.</i> The facts of uniformity which
present themselves in the continuous life of some men
who were absorbed in one great life-purpose, as also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
the conduct of aggregate masses of men, are not denied.
We affirm that the correct definition of a free will supposes
that it may choose in a generally uniform manner.
Much of the uniformity in the life of an individual may
be accounted for by corporeal nature&mdash;disposition, standard
purpose, and habit. "Upon a basis of corporeal,
psychological, and mental nature are overlaid a primary
stratum of dispositions blending the natural and the volitional,
and a secondary formation of generic purposes
wholly volitional, and formed by repetition into a tertiary
of habits; and thus we have, in his mingled constitution
of necessitation and freedom, an agent prepared for daily
free responsible action."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>Now it may be readily granted that character forms a
basis of reliable <i>probability</i> as to how in given circumstances
a man will act. We may be able to judge, with
some degree of accuracy, how a man will work in his freedom;
but we can never calculate with absolute certainty,
because we have numberless examples of men acting
strangely "out of character," and disappointing our most
confident expectations.</p>

<p>"There is often the action, great or small, which reverses
the record of a life or a protracted course of action.
He who well watches his neighbor, however blind he may
be to his own practical self-contradictions, is sure to find,
even in the life most uniform in its great outline, plenty
of minor inconsistencies. Or as Müller, in his 'Doctrine of
Sin,' well says, that both our observation and our subject's
temptation may occur just at the moment of one of his
great volitional turning-points. From the apostasy of the
first angels and the fall of man, through the whole course
of human history, we have innumerable instances of revo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>lutionary
volitions, not only <i>out of the previous character</i>,
but shaping a <i>new</i> character. The one disastrous sin of
Moses, the one great complicated crime of David, the apostasy
of Solomon, the wisest of men, are all proofs how, not
only in contrasted traits, but in revolutionary acts, a man
may be</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.'"<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Statistics are cited by Buckle, in his "History of Civilization
in England," showing that crimes, suicides, marriages,
etc., occur with remarkable uniformity, as the result
of general conditions of human society; and he thence infers
that all the actions of men are governed by a uniform
law of causation. This uniformity may, however, be as
easily accounted for on the doctrine of freedom as on the
doctrine of necessity. In the calculations of contingencies,
while results of compared large aggregates in the
same conditions may approach equality, the <i>contingency
of each individual case remains still a contingency</i>. The
actuary of an insurance company can assert with accuracy
the average duration of human life in different countries;
but were he to attempt to predict the duration of any one
individual life he had insured, he would certainly fail.
The insured may falsify his predictions by a voluntary act
of suicide. So though large aggregations of free volitions,
surrounded by the same motives, may approach equality,
the <i>freedom of the individual will remains</i>.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>And as Mansel very justly remarks, "it is precisely because
individual actions are not reducible to any fixed law,
or capable of representation by any numerical calculation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
that the statistical averages acquire their value as substitutes.
No one dreams of applying statistical averages to
calculate the period of the earth's rotation by showing that
four-and-twenty hours is the exact medium of time, comparing
one month's or one year's revolution with another's.
It is only when individual movements are irregular that it
is necessary to aim at a proximate regularity by calculating
in mass."<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>


<p>3. <i>The Theological Argument.</i>&mdash;The main points of
the theological argument may be thus presented: Freedom
in a created being is incompatible with the absolute
sovereignty and prescience of God. To suppose a being
capable of acting either of several ways is to suppose a
being out of the control of God. And a free agent can
not possess power to do otherwise than God foreknows he
will do.</p>

<p>In regard to the first of these supposed incompatibilities,
we need only remark that if the Deity, in order to the existence
of an equitable moral government, and the consequent
possibility of free responsible action by the creature,
shall please to subject his omnipotence to conditional limitations,
the necessitarian has no business to object.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> We
need feel no solicitude about the Divine sovereignty.
God will take care of his own honor and defend his own
high and holy prerogatives. Such self-limiting laws prescribed
by Divine wisdom and love do not place man
beyond Divine control. The necessitarian will not deny
that such self-limitation is essential to the very existence
of the kingdom of nature. God has established an order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
in nature, a uniformity of antecedence and sequence, with
which Omnipotence shall not interfere. "Such a Divine
law of non-usance of power is still more necessary in the
kingdom of living agents, and most of all in the realm of
responsible agents; it being observable that the more close
the Divine self-restraint, and the larger the amount of
powers in the agent left untouched, the more the creative
system rises in dignity, and the higher God appears as a
sovereign. Even in the system of living <i>necessitated</i>
agents, as necessitarians must admit, God forbids Himself
to disturb the agent's uniform and perpetual acting according
to strongest motive."</p>

<p>The second of these incompatibilities is really predicated
upon our ignorance, and not upon our knowledge. We
can not understand <i>how</i> the Divine Intelligence foreknows
all future events. To enable us to understand the exact
manner in which an Infinite Intelligence contemplates succession
in time, it would be necessary that we should be
infinite also. The <i>fact</i> that God foreknows all future
events is all that is revealed to us; the <i>manner</i> of it
He has left in darkness, and we can throw no light upon
it by our verbal speculations.</p>

<p>Of one thing we may rest assured, that as perception
precedes volition in the finite intelligence, so knowledge
must precede determination in the Divine Mind. God
can not will or act in absolute darkness. Divine predestination
must be conditioned on Divine foreknowledge.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
His foreknowledge does not depend upon his will, or on the
adjustment of motives to make us will thus and thus; but
He foreknows every thing first conditionally, in the world
of possibility, before He creates, or determines any thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
be, in the world of fact. Otherwise, all his purposes would
be grounded in ignorance, not in wisdom, and his knowledge
would consist in following after his will, to learn
what it had blindly determined.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>Another important principle clearly and vigorously maintained
by Dr. Whedon is "that the freeness of an act is
not affected by the consideration of its being foreknown."
First, because the Divine knowledge must always correspond
to the reality. A free action must be known
as <i>free</i>. "If there be in the free agent, ascertainable by
psychology, or required by intuition, or supposably seen
by the Divine eye, the power of putting forth the volition
with full power of alteriety, then God knows that power."<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
Secondly, the occurrence of an event or act may be <i>certain</i>
to Divine foreknowledge, and yet perfectly <i>contingent</i> in
itself. Foreknowledge renders nothing <i>necessary</i>; <i>it is
the consequence, not the cause of events</i>.</p>

<p>If there be a necessity at all in the case, "the necessity
lies not upon the free act, but upon the foreknowledge.
The foreknowledge must see to its own accuracy. Pure
knowledge, temporal or eternal, must conform itself to
the fact, not the fact to the knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The real difficulty
is, not how an act can be a free act and yet be
foreknown (for the act of knowledge can not change the
object of knowledge), but how God can possibly know
with certainty a future contingency which may or may
not happen.</p>

<p>It is a clear and immediate revelation of consciousness
that man has a free power of self-determination. No revelation
can contradict this revelation. This fact of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>sciousness
can not be invalidated by any conceptions of
the logical understanding in regard to the omnipotence or
prescience of God, for these by their very nature transcend
all human comprehension.</p>

<p>III. <i>The method of moral government.</i>&mdash;We have seen
that government, in general, is control exercised with a
view to the maintenance of order. In the material world,
order is secured by the direct compulsion of omnipotent
force. The things of nature are inertly passive under
the hand of God. They can offer no resistance to the Divine
control, and consequently, in the sphere of nature,
there can be no real disorder. But in the realm of self-determining
powers there is the possibility of collision, because
there is the power to resist the will of God. And,
as a matter of fact, we know there is opposition, lawlessness,
and sin. In that sphere, where above all others the
demand of the reason is for order, there is the presence
of <i>disorder</i>&mdash;that is, there is disconformity to law and
consequent suffering.</p>

<p>And now the question arises, By what <i>method</i> is order
to be maintained in the sphere of freedom? How are beings
that have the power to determine for themselves what
they will choose and do, to be brought to act in harmony
with the eternal laws of righteousness and love?</p>

<p>There are inconsiderate souls who dream that this may
be achieved by force. God, say they, is omnipotent; if
He will the non-extension of evil, He is able to destroy
it; if He desire the maintenance of moral order, He can
compel it. Such reckless declaimers know not what they
say.</p>

<p>Had it so pleased God, He could have made beings in
human form without any sense of moral right and wrong,
and without any power to commit sin; but they would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
have been <i>rational</i> beings, would not have been <i>free</i> beings,
would not have been <i>moral</i> beings; neither could they, in
any high and proper sense, be <i>happy</i> beings, because they
could experience no sense of rectitude, no approval of conscience,
no delight in moral excellence, no blessedness in
duty and sacrifice. God, indeed, has made many such
creatures that can not sin. The bee, the ant, the swine,
the ape&mdash;these can not sin; but they are mere things, not
free powers; they have no sense of dignity and moral
worth, no approving conscience, no joy of sacrifice, and no
immortal hopes. Lived there ever a sane man who would
change his lot with one of these, even though in being a
man he has the fearful power to sin, and in sinning, the
fearful susceptibility to suffer&mdash;yea, to suffer eternally? Is
there any thing on earth whose value does not fade away
when compared with the priceless value of being capable
of duty, of virtue, of devotion, and of sacrifice? In the
eyes of God, the humblest of moral beings is worth more
than all the firmament of stars, and all the teeming myriads
of brutal forms of sense that dwell upon the earth.
Because God preferred to rule over free powers, and not
mere things&mdash;free powers that could be governed by truth
and reason and love; because He loves moral character,
and cares for it more than all the things "that can be
piled in the infinitude of space, even though they were diamonds,"
therefore He bestowed on man this high capacity
of character&mdash;the capacity to know, to choose, to love, to
enjoy, and in a conscious communion with God to be
blessed forever.</p>

<p>But when God thus determines to create a rational and
free being&mdash;to make "man in his own image"&mdash;He determines
to make a being who in acting freely may act in opposition
to the mind of God, and in violation of his holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
law. In creating a free self-determined being who shall
be the cause of his own action, God puts his own omnipotence
under conditional limitations, and renders it morally
impossible for Him, by mere force, to constrain the
will of man. The notion of a free will, which is an efficient
cause, being governed by force, is a contradiction.
Omnipotence may, if it please, annihilate man, but it can
not control man in the sphere of his freedom. "Powers
governed by the absolute force or fiat of omnipotence
would in that fact be uncreate and cease."<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>The moral government of God must deal with man <i>as
man</i>, must treat him as intelligent and free, and must govern
him solely by moral influences. He must be controlled
by the voice of reason and the sense of duty, by persuasion
and sympathy, by hope and fear; in short, by motives addressed
to the judgment, the conscience, and the heart. A
self-determined being can be brought into harmony with
the Divine order only by "the schooling of his consent."
He can be perfected&mdash;that is, fully established in harmony
with the character and will of God&mdash;by the discipline of
the will. He must, therefore, be placed in such circumstances
as invite consent, and at the same time permit resistance.
He is to be trained, furnished, and perfected, and
to this end he must be carried through just such experiences,
changes, and trials as will best help the formation
of a noble human character, and will best prepare man for
the plenitude and blessedness of that life for which the
present is a course of education and discipline.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, God's moral government of the world
must deal with the <i>actual man</i>&mdash;that is, with man as he
exists in society with certain hereditary taints that are not
his fault, and under certain unfavorable conditions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
which he has been placed without his consent. With reverence,
we affirm that God Himself is under moral obligation
to treat man equitably, to take account of the weakness
which he inherits, the perverted education that has
been given him, and the depraved associations that surround
him, and graduate his responsibility on the scale of
his available light. Finally, the moral government of God
must deal with <i>the man that will be</i>&mdash;with that fixed
character which may be formed by man in the exercise of
his free power of self-determination, amid the circumstances
of his earthly probation. This character must contain
within itself the elements of a blessed or a wretched
futurition, and thus a retribution be secured by fixed nature,
and inflicted by an inflexible necessity.</p>

<p>That the moral government of God is a probationary
economy, in which ample scope is afforded for the development
of character, and in which we are in the act of being
<i>proved</i>, is evident,</p>

<p>(1.) From the fact <i>that all our future interests are dependent
upon our present conduct</i>. God has endowed
us with some degree of foresight, and has thus made us
provident beings. We have a native tendency to take account
of and forecast the future. By the aid of reason
we can, in some measure, foresee the tendencies of our actions;
we can lay our plans for the future, and anticipate
events which are yet remote. We can also bring to our
aid the lessons of experience, and from this also we can
learn that our present action will have a powerful influence
upon our future condition. We know that the circumstances
which surround us to-day have been in a large
degree created or moulded by ourselves, and that many of
our misadventures and our miseries may be easily traced
back to particular acts of imprudence and folly on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
own part as the cause. So that there is no truth we more
certainly know than this, that our future happiness of the
next moment, and of every succeeding stage of our living,
is dependent upon our present conduct.</p>

<p>(2.) This is further evident from the fact <i>that the present
scene is filled with moral tests and temptations</i>.
There is in the present life an admixture of <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>.
On the one hand there are numerous solicitations to evil;
on the other there are motives and inducements to virtue,
the plain intention of which is to prove us. In the
words of Bishop Butler, "We have here free scope and opportunity
for that good or evil conduct which God will
reward or punish hereafter." This is necessary to moral
government, because moral government can not exist without
freedom of choice, and consequently the existence of
those circumstances in which that freedom can be exercised.
That we have freedom of choice we know; and
our every-day experience of the temptations to wrong-doing,
and of the difficulties in the way of a uniform adherence
to virtue, teaches us that we are in a state of trial,
where our principles are being continually put to the test.</p>

<p>(3.) That our present life is a probation for a future life
is evident from the fact <i>that in the present life punishment
is deferred, consequences are delayed, to give play
to the exercise of moral motives</i>.</p>

<p>By "moral motives" we mean regard for what is right
and just, <i>because it is right and just</i>, respect for the voice
of conscience, and reverence for the will and requirements
of God. If the consequences of our moral conduct were
to follow immediately on the heels of the act, if reward or
punishment were instantly to ensue, then moral motives
could have no exercise. If there were no delay&mdash;no interval
between sin and its punishment, moral government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
would cease, and a merely natural government would remain,
such as prevails over irrational creatures. Man would
then be influenced purely by motives of personal interest
or safety or enjoyment, and his obedience would not be
the result of moral motives, consequently neither virtuous
nor vicious. God has, therefore, put the consequences of
much of our conduct into the future, that we may have
room for free deliberate choice, while just so much of consequence
is permitted to appear as will clearly indicate
that we are under moral government, and awaken the anticipation
that <i>all</i> our conduct will be brought into judgment.</p>

<p>(4.) That our present life is a probation for a future life
is more fully proved by the fact <i>that as a moral economy
the present life is incomplete</i>. The present is a sphere
too contracted for the equitable administration of rewards
and punishments, because some of the <i>last</i> actions of men's
lives, some of their <i>best</i> actions or some of their <i>basest</i> actions,
would come under neither. The blood of the martyrs
who died for the faith, or of the patriot who bled for
his country, would cry alike in vain for vengeance or reward.
The man who first took away his brother's life, and
then his own, has evaded justice, and escaped punishment.
The hand of violence has robbed the virtuous man of his
present reward; and the suicide, by breaking in upon the
sanctuary of his own life, has defied and defeated the government
of God, if there be no future life.</p>

<p>In the present life retribution fails in uniformity. It is
a proposition which the reason of every man must approve&mdash;that
the government of God must be perfectly equitable,
and that under it every man must receive his just due.
But men do not receive their requital in this life, consequently
we are bound to affirm that in the present life the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
Divine administration is <i>incomplete</i>. We can not conceal
from ourselves the fact that events occur in the present
life which we can not conceive as benevolently or righteously
consummated. These events lift the tyrant to
power, and trample down the patriot and the freeman.
The orphan eats the bitter bread of misery, while the man
who has robbed him of the paternal inheritance revels in
luxury. The ungodly prosper in the world, "their eyes
stand out with fatness, they have more than heart could
wish," while the righteous suffer affliction, and are in need.
And if there is no future life in which God will balance
accounts with the universe, and render to every man according
to his works, then moral government is incomplete,
injustice has triumphed, wrong has prevailed. An imperfect
retribution and an unequal providence demand a future
life for their vindication&mdash;a future life both for the
good and the bad, so that God may reckon with all of
them&mdash;and teach most convincingly that the present life
is a probation. The experiences, changes, conflicts, trials of
a probationary economy, are all intended to prove men, to
test their principles and make manifest their real character.</p>

<p>The government of God is a <i>moral discipline</i> by which
men are trained in the practice and confirmed in the habits
of virtue, and thus brought, by the "schooling of their
own consent," into harmony with the Divine order.</p>

<p>It is a question which may be properly entertained,
whether a free self-determined being can be made perfect
in moral character in any other manner than by the discipline
of the will. There certainly can be no created
moral desert. Responsible character must be the product
of free choice. A man can no more become virtuous without
the discipline of the will than he can become intelligent
without the discipline of the understanding. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
wherein consists the virtue of a self-determined being?
Is it not in his free choice of what is right and good, his
resistance to temptation, his voluntary submission to the
Divine will? Is it not in his integrity, his patience, his
fortitude, and his resignation? But how can these virtues
exist, how can they be exercised, and how brought to maturity,
except in the midst of difficulties and hinderances?
Where can patience and resignation and fortitude and
sympathy have a place, if there are no sufferings to be endured?
How can firmness and diligence and courage be
developed, if there are no difficulties and hinderances to
the practice of virtue?</p>

<p>Therefore, in order that men may be trained and educated
and perfected, they are placed amid such scenes, experiences,
and trials as shall draw out the moral powers of
the soul, shall strengthen and confirm the will in goodness,
and establish them in the law of their being, so that
their moral future is secure. "Life, thus ordered, is a magnificent
scheme to bring out the value of law, and teach
the necessity of right as the only conserving principle of
order and happiness; teaching the more powerfully, if so
it must, by disorder and sorrow." Suffering is a chastisement
which is wholesome: it teaches the blessedness of
purity and the sinfulness of sin; and it may develop into
"a godly sorrow" which shall heal and purify the soul.</p>

<p>The moral government of God is an equitable administration,
in which responsibility is graduated on the scale
of available light and opportunity. "This is the condemnation
that <i>light</i> is come into the world." Light is the
symbol of knowledge, because it <i>reveals</i> the right and
clearly manifests what duty is. Light is consequently the
exact measure of responsibility. Our knowledge of what
we ought to do, or ought not to do, determines the degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
of our accountability. An absolute and involuntary ignorance
would be the most perfect plea of innocence. The
imputation of sin in such a case would be made void, but
thereby the completeness of human nature be destroyed.
That which would relegate man from the sphere of responsibility
would also banish him from the sphere of
rationality.</p>

<p>St. Paul distinctly recognizes an alleviation of responsibility
and guilt in the "ignorance" of heathen life, and
speaks of a Divine "overlooking of the times of that ignorance"&mdash;a
non-imputation of sins committed in ignorance.
But he does not by any means account the sinning heathen
as free from <i>all</i> guilt. He shows that they were not
in utter ignorance, and that much of their ignorance was
voluntary. He refers to the original consciousness of God,
and to the fact that this consciousness is kept alive by the
revelation of God in nature; and he shows that the disorder
of their religious and moral life resulted from the
voluntary suppression of this consciousness&mdash;"When they
knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were
thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened." He also appeals to the no
less definite power of conscience in the heart of the heathen,
"which shows the works required by the law to be
written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness
to this law, and their thoughts approving or condemning
each other," and their civil laws "adjudging their
crimes as worthy of death." So far as their ignorance was
involuntary it was an alleviation of guilt, though not an
excuse for all sin. Whatever light they had, be it little or
much, it was the standard and measure of their accountability.</p>

<p>The Founder of Christianity distinctly recognized this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
principle of moral government. "If I had not come and
spoken unto them, <i>they had not had sin</i>, but now they
have no cloak for their sin"&mdash;clearly teaching that ignorance
would be a negation of guilt, and knowledge an
aggravation of guilt. Not that we are to suppose that the
Jews, without the light which Christ supplied, were absolutely
guiltless; their ignorance was a mitigation of their
guilt. Christ lays it down as a universal principle that
knowledge of the Divine law or ignorance of the Divine
law by the person who violates it is the ground of a distinction
in the different degrees of culpability. "That
servant which <i>knew</i> his lord's will, and prepared not himself,
neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with
<i>many</i> stripes. But he that <i>knew not</i>, and did commit
things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with <i>few</i> stripes."<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
This is the uniform rule of the Divine government among
all nations.</p>

<p>Increase of light and knowledge necessarily enhances
human responsibility. "To whomsoever much is given, of
him shall be much required." More is expected of the
man than of the child. More is demanded at the hands
of the man who has been blessed with the advantages of a
Christian civilization than from the untutored savage.
The man who has been favored with a liberal education
is held to a more rigid account than the man who has been
cradled in ignorance and schooled in vice. And when the
kingdom of God comes nigh to men, human responsibility
must be enlarged in commensuration with its blessings.
There is a holier, richer trust, and consequently a deeper
obligation. There is a greater light and a greater condemnation.</p>

<p>"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
for if the mighty works which were done in you had been
done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long
ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall
be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment
than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted
unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if
the mighty works which have been done in thee had been
done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>This aspect of the Divine government, which Dr. Whedon
has felicitously styled "the equation of probational advantages,"
relieves our sadness in view of the moral condition
of the world. "The Judge of all the earth will do right"
in the case of every human soul that has passed through
this probationary scene. His omniscient eye can take in at
one view all the influences and circumstances, favorable or
unfavorable, which have surrounded each individual, and
fix the precise amount of responsibility. He will "overlook"
the "defect of doubt and taints of blood," the faults
of education and sins of ignorance, and He will make a
due allowance for the power of temptation, the trammels of
evil associations, and an enfeebled and perverted nature.
"He is full of compassion, and his tender mercies are over
all his works." "He knows our frame, and He remembers
that we are dust." We may safely conjecture that
a negro hamlet in Central Africa, however inferior in its
temporal moral aspects, may, in its prospect for an eternal
destiny, be superior to many an American village. And
in the dregs of our large cities there are numbers who are
excluded as effectually from the knowledge of the truth as
the heathen, and are scarcely developed to the level of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
responsibility. These may be the least in the kingdom of
heaven, but by the law of moral equation they can not be
excluded.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> In every nation under heaven, he that has
feared God and wrought righteousness, according to his
knowledge and ability, will be "<i>accepted of God</i>."</p>

<p>The moral government of God secures an infallible
and equitable retribution by binding <i>character</i> and <i>consequence</i>
in indissoluble bonds, and evolving a reward or a
punishment out of that permanent moral state of the soul
which has been induced by the free self-determination of
man.</p>

<p>"Character," says Novalis, "is a completely fashioned
will (<i>vollkommen gebildeter Wille</i>). It is that ultimate
stress and determination of the soul which results from the
coherence and complexure of habits, and habit is the result
of repeated acts of voluntary choice. From the persistence
of habit a fixed disposition and cast of the inner
man is evolved which constitutes his <i>moral individuality</i>."</p>

<p>Even in this formative process we can discern the workings
of the law of retribution. One good deed handsels a
second, and renders its performance more easy and pleasurable.
The man who obeys his conscience feels that he can
respect himself. He has a consciousness of growing power;
a sense of dignity and moral worth. The moral law is for
him "a law of liberty." On the other hand, one sinful
deed involves a second, and drags it after it. One lie demands
another to maintain its consistency. One act of
injustice emboldens to the next. Self-respect is broken
down by license, and the path is prepared and cleared for
further iniquity. Thus, by the repetition of sinful deeds,
restraints are overborne, depraved habits are engendered,
vice acquires a mastery over the man, and he becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
slave. There is a deep humiliation in this sense of degradation
and unworthiness. The sinner despises himself because
of his weakness, and blushes in secret places at the
remembrance of his own debasement.</p>

<p>The principal happiness or misery of man consists in the
settled state of his own heart, and not in the outward conditions
of his daily life. All human plaudits are as naught
compared with the approval of one's own conscience; and
no penal inflictions can compare with the anguish of remorse.
The inward peace of the righteous soul, the disquietude
and misery of the sinful soul, are the blossom
and the fruitage of the seed which has been sown, and the
stem and branches which have been nurtured by the voluntary
choices and acts of man. "He that soweth to his
flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth
to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting." The
connection between sin and punishment is no arbitrary or
accidental connection. It is just as much a relation between
cause and effect as the relation between sowing
and reaping in the physical world. "To cause the mind
to punish itself, to work a retribution out of ourselves, to
secure it by fixed nature, to inflict it by inflexible necessity,
to convert the capacity of sin into the instrument of suffering,
is the prerogative of Divine rule."<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>IV. <i>The end of moral government.</i>&mdash;We have said that
the end of government, in general, is the maintenance of
order. The end of moral government is the maintenance
of <i>moral order</i> in the realm of free self-determined powers.
The moral order must consist in conformity to the
idea of the <i>absolute good</i>. The personality of God (the
essential momenta of which are reason and freedom, holiness
and love) is <i>per se</i>, in its totality, the absolute good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
Infinite Personality is but another name for Absolute Perfection.</p>

<p>The highest good for a created dependent personality is
"to resemble God" in all those attributes or perfections
which constitute personality. It is to be fully established
in harmony with God's moral character, unified with Him
in will, glorified with Him in holiness, and perfected with
Him in the blessedness of love. The highest perfection
of personal being is moral order, and therefore human
personality, conceived in its purity and perfection, is the
end of the Divine government.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>This we have called "the ideal order of moral life," because
it is not yet realized in the world. We must believe,
however, that the final triumph of goodness is a
part of the great world-plan. We must not only believe,
but know, that the great design of creation, the reason for
which the world exists at all, is that in it goodness may
come to its final realization. And this conviction is grounded
on the fact that the moral life of humanity has its source
in the same Being who called the world into existence, and
who is conducting this present dispensation to a glorious
consummation, in which He shall "reconcile all things
unto Himself,... whether they be things in earth or things
in heaven," and "gather together in one all things in
Christ," that "God may be all in all."</p>

<p>Christianity bases all the obligations and sanctions of
morality on the great truths that God is near to man, that
He sustains him every moment in life, that He is the Father
of the human spirit, and that He governs man in order to
perfect his nature and bring him into an everlasting fel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>lowship
with Himself. Christianity knows nothing of "a
science of morals" which is not based upon the correlations
between man and God, nor of a morality which
forgets God and disregards the most sacred and fundamental
of all duties, namely, the duties we owe to God.
A morality based solely upon the relations in which we
stand to our fellow-men is at best but secular and utilitarian.
A morality which is grounded upon the relation of
volition to the state of the sensibility, and regards "happiness
as our being's end and aim," is egoistic and selfish.
A morality which rests upon our relation to God, the absolute
good, and which looks backward rather than forward
for its motive, is unselfish and Christian.</p>

"No army of argument, no accumulation of contempt, no historical
exhibition of the fruitlessness of its effort, has sufficed to extirpate the
tendency toward metaphysical speculation. Although its doctrines have
become a scoff (except among the valiant few), its method still survives, still
prompts to renewed research, and still misleads some men of science. In
vain History points to the failure of twenty centuries; the metaphysician admits
the fact, but appeals to History in proof of the persistent passion which
no failure can dismay; and hence draws confidence in ultimate success. A
cause which is vigorous after centuries of defeat is a cause baffled but not
hopeless, beaten but not subdued. The ranks of its army may be thinned,
its banners torn and mud-stained; but the indomitable energy breaks out
anew, and the fight is continued."&mdash;"Problems of Life and Mind," p. 7.</p></div>

but in reality each has its own peculiar shade of meaning. Here we
employ the term <i>Absolute</i> to denote the underived, independent, incomposite,

which can not be bounded, measured, quantified. <i>Perfect</i> is employed
to denote that which is complete, finished, self-sufficient&mdash;that which
has no defect and no want. <i>The unconditioned</i> is a genus, of which the Infinite,
Absolute, and Perfect are species&mdash;not conditioned by quantity, kind,
or degree. For the Infinite there are no limits; for the Absolute no parts,
no equals, and no change; for the Perfect no wants. See Calderwood,

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> We make no pretensions to critical acquaintance with the Hebrew, but
will hazard this suggestion, עָשָׂה (aysah) is the most general term; its fundamental
meaning is <i>to do, to perform, to work</i>, and may embrace both origination
and formation. בָּרָא (bara) and יִצֶר (yetsar) are more specific, the
former denoting the origination of a new essence or substance, the latter
formation or fashioning out of pre-existing materials. Thus we read in
Gen. ii. 7: "And the Lord God formed [יִצֶר] man [<i>i. e.</i>, the body of man]
out of the dust of the earth." Here we have pre-existing matter. But in
Gen. i. 27 we read, "And God created [בָּרָא] man [<i>i. e.</i>, the soul of man]
in his own image." Here we have no pre-existing material, for matter
can not bear the image of God. (See Acts xvii. 29.) <i>Bara</i> must therefore
here mean origination. Even in Gen. i. 21, where <i>bara</i> is employed
in regard to the production of <i>living creatures</i>, we have the origination of
something new: for <i>vitality</i>, <i>sensitivity</i>, <i>perception</i> are not properties of matter,
neither can they be educed from any organization of matter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> We can not help regarding this mode of reasoning as superficial and
misleading. Gen. i. 27, "So God created [בָּרָא] man in <i>his own image</i>,"
refers to the spiritual nature of man which alone can bear the "image of
God," and must mean <i>origination</i>. Gen. ii. 7, "And the Lord God formed
[עָשָׂה] man out of the dust of the earth," refers solely to the body of man.
This distinction can scarcely be accidental.</p></div>

reasonably doubted whether "absolute vacuity" has any place in the universe
of God. As a question of science, the existence of the "vacuum" is
doubtful. "It may be safely asserted that hitherto all attempts at producing
a perfect vacuum have failed."&mdash;Grove, "Correlation of Physical
Forces," p. 134. The general tendency of science is toward a denial of its
existence (p. 137). As a question of metaphysics, the human reason can
only find satisfaction in believing in a spiritual Being, a living Will which
"inhabiteth eternity and immensity," and "filleth all in all" with living and
life-giving fullness, so that "in Him we live and move and have being."&mdash;McCosh,

The practice so common among writers of Natural Theology of fixing
upon one line of proof of the being of God as the only valid method, and then
disparaging and endeavoring to show the invalidity of all others, is highly
reprehensible. The strongest arguments employed by the Atheists have
been culled from the writings of these eccentric theologians. In the celebrated
public discussion between Mr. Holyoake, the leader of the Secularists
in England, and Mr. Brindley, "On the existence of God," the most telling
arguments of Mr. Holyoake were drawn from the standard works on Natural
Theology. How much more rational and commendable is the course of the
philosopher: "There are different proofs of the existence of God. The consoling
result of my studies is that these different proofs are more or less
strict in form, but they have all a depth of truth which needs only to be disengaged
and put in a clear light in order to give incontestable authority.
Every thing leads to God. There is no bad way of arriving at Him, but we
go to Him by different paths."&mdash;Cousin, "History of Philosophy," vol. ii.
p. 418.
</p>
<p>
The argument for the being of a God in its completeness is at once Ontological
and Cosmological, Etiological and Teleological. It is in the concurrence
and synthesis of these separate but harmonious lines of proof that we
have an unanswerable demonstration. For ourselves, we are convinced,
with Neitzsch, that the Ontological proof is first and last; they who seek to
invalidate this cut the ground from under all the rest.</p></div>

by which He produces it. In this sense it is literally true: <i>All things are of
God</i> (Rom. xi. 33). This admission of a supramaterial physis in God&mdash;this

he said, "to form some rude conception of the <i>creation of matter</i>, if we suppose
that God by his power had prevented the entrance of any thing into a
certain portion of pure space which is of its nature penetrable,... from
henceforward this portion of space will be endowed with <i>impenetrability</i>,
one of the essential qualities of matter; and as pure space is absolutely uniform,
we have only to suppose that God communicated the same impenetrability
to another portion of space, and we should obtain in a certain sort the
notion of <i>mobility</i>, another quality which is essential to matter."&mdash;M. Coste,

with his lamented friend, Dr. Hawtrey, Head-Master and late Provost of
Eton College, on the subject of Etymology, I happened to remark that the
syllable <i>Ur</i> or <i>Or</i> must have some very remote origin, having found its way
into many languages, conveying the idea of something absolute, solemn, definite,
fundamental, or of unknown antiquity, as in the German <i>Ur-alt</i> (primeval),
<i>Ur-satz</i> (a fundamental proposition), <i>Ur-theil</i> (a solemn judgment)&mdash;in
the Latin <i>Oriri</i> (to arise), <i>Origo</i> (the origin), <i>Aurora</i> (the dawn)&mdash;in the
Greek Ὄρος (a boundary, the extreme limit of our vision, whence our horizon),
Ὄρκος (an oath or solemn obligation, etc.). 'You are right,' was his reply,
'it is the oldest word of all words: the first word ever recorded to have
been pronounced. It is the Hebrew for <i>Light</i>'" (אוֹר, <span class="smcap">AOR</span>).&mdash;"Familiar

Dr. Winchell and myself in regard to how much of chapter i. is to be regarded
as the "Exordium" of the Hymn of Creation. Dr. Winchell includes
verses 1 and 2; I incline, however, to the opinion that it is embraced
in verse 1. The reasons which weigh with me are the following: 1. The
chaos or the darkness of verse 2 is clearly recognized as "the <i>evening</i>" of the
first day, "And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night;
and there was evening and morning: one day." I do not see how on a fair
interpretation of the sacred poem we can escape the conclusion that the <i>first</i>
day embraces "the evening and morning"&mdash;that is, the primal darkness of
verse 2, and the creation of dawning light. This conception furthermore harmonizes
with the Hebrew usage, which always regarded the preceding night
as part of the one natural day. The Hebrew Sabbath commenced at six
o'clock on Friday evening. Thus we read in Leviticus xxiii. 32, "From
even to even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath." Hence also the evening&mdash;morning
= day (νυχθή-μερον)&mdash;of Daniel viii. 14. 2. The division I have
made is the one which has been followed by the best Hebrew scholars, whose
opinion is entitled to the highest deference in this connection. The independent
character of the opening sentence of Genesis was affirmed by such
judicious and learned men as Calvin, Bishop Patrick, and Dr. D. Jennings.
The early fathers of the Church, as St. Gregory of Nazianzen, St. Justin Martyr,
Origen, St. Augustine, and others, held that there was a considerable interval
between the creation related in the first verse, and that of which an
account is given in the third and following verses. See "The Pre-Adamite
Earth," by Dr. Harris, p. 281.</p></div>

any thing, short of the ever-present and pervading energy which we advocate.
At least, the arguments which would establish such a relation of the
Deity to the material universe as amounts to "superintendence and control,"
would go far to establish the doctrine of a real presence and agency of God
pervading and upholding all nature. Superintendence and control imply
some agency, some efficiency, and some <i>intervention</i> of righteousness or mercy
to secure other ends than those secured by the established course of nature,
for whoever <i>overrules</i> steps on a field beyond his ordinary <i>rule</i>. The physical
laws are, therefore, simply God's uniform mode of governing the world.
This is the conclusion which is reached by Proctor ("Other Worlds than
Ours"). In his chapter on "Supervision and Control" (ch. xiii.), he says:
"Thus we are led to the conclusion that all things happen according to set
physical laws; and without, by any means, adopting the view that the Almighty
exercises no special control over his universe, we see strong reason to
believe that the laws which He has assigned to it are sufficient for the control
of all things. Indeed, as far as all things take place in accordance with
laws which the Almighty must assuredly have Himself ordained, we may say
that <i>every event which has happened or will happen throughout infinite time
is the direct work and indicates the direct purpose and will of Almighty God</i>"
(pp. 329, 332); and further, "<i>He who made the laws may annul or suspend
them at his pleasure</i>" (p. 333).</p></div>

maxim that "two substances may occupy the same point in space at the
same time <i>provided their qualities are essentially different</i>." If the qualities
of the ether are essentially different from gross matter, then to call ether
"matter" is to confound and mislead the mind. May not ether be a "tertium
quid" between matter and mind?</p></div>

takes place without Thee, O Deity, except that which bad men do through their
own want of reason; but even that which is evil is overruled by Thee for good,
and is made to harmonize with the plan of the world."&mdash;<i>Hymn to Zeus.</i></p></div>

derivation of the material organism of the primitive man. If the hypothesis
be true that "man is the descendant of some pre-existent generic type, the
which, if it were now living, we would probably call an ape," this can only
be affirmed of the body of man, and the statement is still correct that "God
formed man of the dust of the earth." The body of the ape and the body
of man are formed of the same materials. But, as Prof. Cope, a thorough-going
Evolutionist, remarks, this material nature can not bear or be "the
image of God," for "God is a spirit," and "a spirit hath not flesh and
bones" (Luke xxiv. 39). The image of God must inhere in that spiritual
nature which was inbreathed by God, and consists in reason, conscience, and
moral liberty. (See Cope, "On the Hypothesis of Evolution," pp. 33, 34.)
This theory as to the descent of man's material organism from some pre-existent
generic type does not by any means involve the conclusion of Sir J.
Lubbock that "the primitive condition of mankind was one of <i>utter barbarism</i>."
We may grant that the primitive condition of man was one of childhood
ignorance and inexperience, a state in which his intellectual and moral
nature was undeveloped; but this is not "Savagism." Barbarism is the
lapse and deterioration of man. Even if it could be shown that primeval
man was destitute of the industrious arts, "it would not afford the slightest
presumption that he was also ignorant of duty or ignorant of God" ("Primeval
Man," by the Duke of Argyll, p. 132). "Whenever we can trace back
a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that
affect it in its later stages" (Max Müller, "Chips from a German Workshop,"
vol. i., preface). The most ancient form of religion was the Monotheistic
(Grimm, "Deutsche Mythologie," p. xliv. 3d ed.). See also "Les
Origines Indo-Européennes," vol. ii. p. 720, by M. Adolphe Pictet.</p></div>

which the word Indo-European embodies&mdash;the affinity of the principal nations
of Europe with the Arian or Indo-Persic stock&mdash;is sufficiently indicated
by the conjunction of the Madai or Medes (whose native name is Mada)
with Gomer of the Cymry, and Javan of the Ionians. Again, one of the
most recent and unexpected results of modern linguistic inquiry is the proof
which it has furnished of an ethnic connection between the Ethiopians or
Cushites, who adjoined on Egypt, and the primitive inhabitants of Babylonia;
a connection which was positively denied by an eminent ethnologist
only a few years ago, but which has now been sufficiently established from
the cuneiform monuments. In the tenth chapter of Genesis (vers. 8-10) we
find this truth thus briefly stated: 'And Cush begat Nimrod,' the 'beginning
of whose kingdom was Babel' (ver. 11). So we have had it recently made
evident from the same monuments that 'out of that land went forth Asshur,
and builded Nineveh'&mdash;or that the Semitic Assyrians proceeded from Babylonia
and founded Nineveh long after the Cushite foundation of Babylon.
Again, the Hamitic descent of the early inhabitants of Canaan, which had
often been called in question, has recently come to be looked upon as almost
certain, apart from the evidence of Scripture; and the double mention of
Sheba, both among the sons of Ham, and also among those of Shem (vers.
7 and 28), has been illustrated by the discovery that there are two races
of Arabs&mdash;one (the Joktanian) Semitic, the other (the Himyaric) Cushite or
Ethiopic."&mdash;Rawlinson's "Historical Evidences," pp. 71, 72.</p></div>

Froude defines religion as "the attitude of reverence in which noble-minded
men instinctively place themselves toward the Unknown Power which
made man and his dwelling-place. It is the natural accompaniment of their
lives, the sanctification of their actions and their acquirements. It is what
gives to man in the midst of the rest of Creation his special elevation and

of science cometh not by observation and experiment alone, but is completed
by fixing the roots of observation and experiment in <i>a region inaccessible to
both</i>, and in dealing with which we are forced to fall back upon the picturing
power of the mind"&mdash;"<i>Einbildungskraft</i>"&mdash;the force of imagination
(Preface to seventh edition). Are we then to believe that the imagination
is the source of scientific principles, that it has any "power of intuition, or
can in any way create its own objects?" Why does he not fall back on his
"<i>Anschauungsgabe</i>," or faculty of rational intuition, and admit that he is
in the region of the metaphysical? See "Fragments of Science," p. 130.</p></div>

for example, the averting of disease or the fall of rain, to be "irrational and
unconsciously irreverent." "I repeat that no theory of the universe, no philosophy
of human nature, and no conclusion of science can ever lay an arrest
upon the instincts of the universal heart in the presence of calamity, and with
the prospect of its increase. Let men philosophize as they will, and let science
march where it will (conquering realm after realm, and reducing all
under the rigor of law), the human spirit will always 'cry unto God' in
times of crisis, and will find immeasurable solace in 'committing its causes'
unto Him; for the instinct to pray for relief in times of anxiety or of peril
is one which can never be exorcised from the heart of man. But it does
not follow that it will always (or that it ought ever) to imagine that by so
doing it can deflect the order of nature or induce God to alter his prearrangements.
The relief obtained is in the act of <i>submission</i> and of filial trust,
not in the notion of being able to persuade an infinitely powerful and sympathetic
Listener" ("Prayer: 'The Two Spheres:' They <i>are</i> Two," by the
Rev. William Knight, <i>Contemporary Review</i>, December, 1873, p. 35). Of
course we have no reason to expect that Dr. Tyndall should yield his judgment
to the authority of Scripture, but we may legitimately expect the Rev.
William Knight, of the Free Church of Scotland, to defer in some measure
to James v. 13-18.</p></div>
